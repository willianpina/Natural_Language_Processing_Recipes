    "De acordo com estimativas da indústria, mais de 80% dos dados gerados estão em um formato não estruturado na forma de texto, imagens, áudio ou vídeo. Os dados estão sendo gerados à medida que falamos, escrevemos, tweetamos, usamos plataformas de mídia social, enviamos mensagens em plataformas de mensagens, usamos comércio eletrônico para fazer compras e fazemos várias outras atividades. A maioria desses dados existe na forma textual.\n",

    "Então, o que são dados não estruturados? Dados não estruturados são informações que não residem em um banco de dados relacional tradicional. Exemplos incluem documentos, blogs, feeds de mídia social, fotos e vídeos.\n",
    "\n",
    "A maioria dos insights está bloqueada em diferentes tipos de dados não estruturados. O desbloqueio de dados não estruturados desempenha um papel vital em todas as organizações que desejam tomar decisões cada vez melhores. Este livro desbloqueia o potencial dos dados textuais.\n",
    "\n",
    "Os dados textuais são os mais comuns e compreendem mais de 50% dos dados não estruturados. Exemplos incluem tweets/postagens em mídias sociais, conversas de bate-papo, notícias, blogs, artigos, análises de produtos ou serviços e registros de pacientes no setor de saúde. Exemplos recentes incluem bots acionados por voz, como Siri e Alexa."

    "Para recuperar insights significativos e acionáveis de dados textuais e desbloquear seu potencial, usamos processamento de linguagem natural juntamente com aprendizado de máquina e aprendizado profundo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mas o que é processamento de linguagem natural? Máquinas e algoritmos não entendem texto ou caracteres, por isso é muito importante converter dados textuais em um formato compreensível por máquina (como números ou binários) para analisá-los. O processamento de linguagem natural (NLP) permite que as máquinas entendam e interpretem a linguagem humana.\n",
    "\n",
    "Se você quiser usar o poder do texto não estruturado, este livro é o ponto de partida certo. Este livro desenterra os conceitos e a implementação do processamento de linguagem natural e suas aplicações no mundo real. A PNL oferece oportunidades ilimitadas para resolver problemas interessantes em inteligência artificial, tornando-a a fronteira mais recente para o desenvolvimento de aplicativos inteligentes baseados em aprendizado profundo."

    "## Introdução\n",
    "Antes de entrar nos detalhes do livro, vamos examinar as fontes de dados geralmente disponíveis. Precisamos identificar fontes de dados em potencial que podem ajudar a resolver casos de uso de ciência de dados.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dados do cliente\n",
    "Para qualquer declaração de problema, uma das fontes são os dados que já estão presentes. A empresa decide onde deseja armazenar seus dados. O armazenamento de dados depende do tipo de negócio, da quantidade de dados e dos custos associados às fontes. Seguem alguns exemplos:\n",
    "* Bancos de dados SQL\n",
    "* HDFS\n",
    "* Armazenamento na núvem\n",
    "* Arquivos simples\n",

      "A poesia, ou texto lírico, é uma das  tradicionais, pela qual a linguagem humana é utilizada com fins estéticos ou críticos, ou seja, ela retrata algo em que tudo pode acontecer dependendo da imaginação do autor como a do leitor. Poesia, segundo o modo comum de falar, quer dizer duas coisas. A arte, que a ensina, e a obra feita com a arte; a arte é a poesia, a obra , o poeta o artífice. O  da mensagem poética também pode ser, ainda que seja a forma  a definir um  como poético. A poesia compreende aspectos metafísicos e a possibilidade desses elementos transcenderem ao mundo fático. Esse é o terreno que compete verdadeiramente ao poeta.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Num contexto mais alargado, a poesia aparece também identificada com a própria arte, o que tem razão de ser já que qualquer arte é, também, uma forma de  (ainda que, não necessariamente, verbal). É a arte de poetizar que nos permite exprimir aquilo que está dentro de nós. Também pode ser encarado, como o modo de uma pessoa se expressar usando recursos linguísticos e estéticos. \n",
      "\n",
      "Diversos autores, ao longo da história, buscaram conceituar a poesia. Uma das obras fundamentais foi do pensador grego , que não definia a poética como mera composição em versos, afinal, até tratados de Medicina eram escritos em versos. Segundo , em seu livro Iniciação à Estética, a poesia é “uma linguagem com predominância da imagem e da metáfora sobre a precisão e a clareza”.  \n",

      "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.  The goal is a computer capable of \"understanding\" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.\n",
      "\n",
      "The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules.  Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.  This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.[6]\n",

      "In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing. That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques[7][8] can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling[9] and parsing.[10][11] This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early days, many language-processing systems were designed by symbolic methods, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules, coupled with a dictionary lookup:[13][14] such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.\n",
      "\n",
      "More recent systems based on machine-learning algorithms have many advantages over hand-produced rules: \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the popularity of machine learning in NLP research, symbolic methods are still (2020) commonly used:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the so-called \"statistical revolution\"[15][16] in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, much natural language processing research has relied heavily on machine learning. The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora (the plural form of corpus, is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations) of typical real-world examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many different classes of machine-learning algorithms have been applied to natural-language-processing tasks. These algorithms take as input a large set of \"features\" that are generated from the input data. Increasingly, however, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to each input feature (complex-valued embeddings,[17] and neural networks in general have also been proposed, for e.g. speech[18]). Such models have the advantage that they can express the relative certainty of many different possible answers rather than only one, producing more reliable results when such a model is included as a component of a larger system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules.  However, part-of-speech tagging introduced the use of hidden Markov models to natural language processing, and increasingly, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to the features making up the input data. The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models.  Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the neural turn, statistical methods in NLP research have been largely replaced by neural networks. However, they continue to be relevant for contexts in which statistical interpretability and transparency is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. Since 2015,[19] the field has thus largely abandoned statistical methods and shifted to neural networks for machine learning. Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term neural machine translation (NMT) emphasizes the fact that deep learning-based approaches to machine translation directly learn sequence-to-sequence transformations, obviating the need for intermediate steps such as word alignment and language modeling that was used in statistical machine translation (SMT).\n",
      "\n",
      "The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. A coarse division is given below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP. As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above).\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognition refers to \"the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.\"[41] Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes.[42] Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[43] Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics,[44] with two defining aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s. Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar,[46] functional grammar,[47] construction grammar,[48] computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences[49] of the ACL). More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of \"cognitive AI\".[50] Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit).[51]\n",

      " start of the project gutenberg ebook the idiot the idiot by fyodor dostoyevsky translated by eva martin contents part i part ii part iii part iv part i i. towards the end of november during a thaw at nine o clock one morning a train on the warsaw and petersburg railway was approaching the latter city at full speed. the morning was so damp and misty that it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the carriage windows. some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad but the third class carriages were the best filled chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees picked up at the different stations nearer town. all of them seemed weary and most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression while their complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside. when day dawned two passengers in one of the third class carriages found themselves opposite each other. both were young fellows both were rather poorly dressed both had remarkable faces and both were evidently anxious to start a conversation. if they had but known why at this particular moment they were both remarkable persons they would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set them down opposite to one another in a third class carriage of the warsaw railway company. one of them was a young fellow of about twenty seven not tall with black curling hair and small grey fiery eyes. his nose was broad and flat and he had high cheek bones his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent ironical it might almost be called a malicious smile but his forehead was high and well formed and atoned for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. a special feature of this physiognomy was its death like pallor which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent sarcastic smile and keen self satisfied bearing. he wore a large fur or rather astrachan overcoat which had kept him warm all night while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a russian november night entirely unprepared. his wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the winter months in switzerland or north italy was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through russia from eydkuhnen to st. petersburg. the wearer of this cloak was a young fellow also of about twenty six or twenty seven years of age slightly above the middle height very fair with a thin pointed and very light coloured beard his eyes were large and blue and had an intent look about them yet that heavy expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence of an epileptic subject. his face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that refined but quite colourless except for the circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold. he held a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe and wore thick shoes and gaiters his whole appearance being very un russian. his black haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities having nothing better to do and at length remarked with that rude enjoyment of the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show cold very said his neighbour readily and this is a thaw too. fancy if it had been a hard frost i never thought it would be so cold in the old country. i ve grown quite out of the way of it. what been abroad i suppose yes straight from switzerland. wheugh my goodness the black haired young fellow whistled and then laughed. the conversation proceeded. the readiness of the fair haired young man in the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbour s questions was surprising. he seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him. replying to them he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had been long absent from russia more than four years that he had been sent abroad for his health that he had suffered from some strange nervous malady a kind of epilepsy with convulsive spasms. his interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers and more than ever when to the question whether he had been cured the patient replied no they did not cure me. hey that s it you stumped up your money for nothing and we believe in those fellows here remarked the black haired individual sarcastically. gospel truth sir gospel truth exclaimed another passenger a shabbily dressed man of about forty who looked like a clerk and possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face. gospel truth all they do is to get hold of our good russian money free gratis and for nothing. oh but you re quite wrong in my particular instance said the swiss patient quietly. of course i can t argue the matter because i know only my own case but my doctor gave me money and he had very little to pay my journey back besides having kept me at his own expense while there for nearly two years. why was there no one else to pay for you asked the black haired one. no mr. pavlicheff who had been supporting me there died a couple of years ago. i wrote to mrs. general epanchin at the time she is a distant relative of mine but she did not answer my letter. and so eventually i came back. and where have you come to that is where am i going to stay i i really don t quite know yet i both the listeners laughed again. i suppose your whole set up is in that bundle then asked the first. i bet anything it is exclaimed the red nosed passenger with extreme satisfaction and that he has precious little in the luggage van though of course poverty is no crime we must remember that it appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. the young fellow hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness. your bundle has some importance however continued the clerk when they had laughed their fill it was observable that the subject of their mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing for though i dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs d or and louis d or judge from your costume and gaiters still if you can add to your possessions such a valuable property as a relation like mrs. general epanchin then your bundle becomes a significant object at once. that is of course if you really are a relative of mrs. epanchin s and have not made a little error through well absence of mind which is very common to human beings or say through a too luxuriant fancy oh you are right again said the fair haired traveller for i really am almost wrong when i say she and i are related. she is hardly a relation at all so little in fact that i was not in the least surprised to have no answer to my letter. i expected as much. h m you spent your postage for nothing then. h m you are candid however and that is commendable. h m mrs. epanchin oh yes a most eminent person. i know her. as for mr. pavlicheff who supported you in switzerland i know him too at least if it was nicolai andreevitch of that name a fine fellow he was and had a property of four thousand souls in his day. yes nicolai andreevitch that was his name and the young fellow looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all knowing gentleman with the red nose. this sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class. they are people who know everyone that is they know where a man is employed what his salary is whom he knows whom he married what money his wife had who are his cousins and second cousins etc. etc. these men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on and they spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style of knowledge which they reduce or raise to the standard of a science. during the latter part of the conversation the black haired young man had become very impatient. he stared out of the window and fidgeted and evidently longed for the end of the journey. he was very absent he would appear to listen and heard nothing and he would laugh of a sudden evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about. excuse me said the red nosed man to the young fellow with the bundle rather suddenly whom have i the honour to be talking to prince lef nicolaievitch muishkin replied the latter with perfect readiness. prince muishkin lef nicolaievitch h m i don t know i m sure i may say i have never heard of such a person said the clerk thoughtfully. at least the name i admit is historical. karamsin must mention the family name of course in his history but as an individual one never hears of any prince muishkin nowadays. of course not replied the prince there are none except myself. i believe i am the last and only one. as to my forefathers they have always been a poor lot my own father was a sublieutenant in the army. i don t know how mrs. epanchin comes into the muishkin family but she is descended from the princess muishkin and she too is the last of her line. and did you learn science and all that with your professor over there asked the black haired passenger. oh yes i did learn a little but i ve never learned anything whatever said the other. oh but i learned very little you know added the prince as though excusing himself. they could not teach me very much on account of my illness. do you know the rogojins asked his questioner abruptly. no i don t not at all i hardly know anyone in russia. why is that your name yes i am rogojin parfen rogojin. parfen rogojin dear me then don t you belong to those very rogojins perhaps began the clerk with a very perceptible increase of civility in his tone. yes those very ones interrupted rogojin impatiently and with scant courtesy. i may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the blotchy faced passenger and had hitherto addressed all his remarks direct to the prince. dear me is it possible observed the clerk while his face assumed an expression of great deference and servility if not of absolute alarm what a son of that very semen rogojin hereditary honourable citizen who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of roubles and how do you know that he left two million and a half of roubles asked rogojin disdainfully and not deigning so much as to look at the other. however it s true enough that my father died a month ago and that here am i returning from pskoff a month after with hardly a boot to my foot. they ve treated me like a dog i ve been ill of fever at pskoff the whole time and not a line nor farthing of money have i received from my mother or my confounded brother and now you ll have a million roubles at least goodness gracious me exclaimed the clerk rubbing his hands. five weeks since i was just like yourself continued rogojin addressing the prince with nothing but a bundle and the clothes i wore. i ran away from my father and came to pskoff to my aunt s house where i caved in at once with fever and he went and died while i was away. all honour to my respected father s memory but he uncommonly nearly killed me all the same. give you my word prince if i hadn t cut and run then when i did he d have murdered me like a dog. i suppose you angered him somehow asked the prince looking at the millionaire with considerable curiosity. but though there may have been something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the prince more than that. rogojin too seemed to have taken up the conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a considerable state of excitement if not absolutely feverish and was in real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking as safety valve to his agitation. as for his red nosed neighbour the latter since the information as to the identity of rogojin hung over him seemed to be living on the honey of his words and in the breath of his nostrils catching at every syllable as though it were a pearl of great price. oh yes i angered him i certainly did anger him replied rogojin. but what puts me out so is my brother. of course my mother couldn t do anything she s too old and whatever brother senka says is law for her but why couldn t he let me know he sent a telegram they say. what s the good of a telegram it frightened my aunt so that she sent it back to the office unopened and there it s been ever since it s only thanks to konief that i heard at all he wrote me all about it. he says my brother cut off the gold tassels from my father s coffin at night because they re worth a lot of money says he. why i can get him sent off to siberia for that alone if i like it s sacrilege. here you scarecrow he added addressing the clerk at his side is it sacrilege or not by law sacrilege certainly certainly sacrilege said the latter. and it s siberia for sacrilege isn t it undoubtedly so siberia of course they will think that i m still ill continued rogojin to the prince but i sloped off quietly seedy as i was took the train and came away. aha brother senka you ll have to open your gates and let me in my boy i know he told tales about me to my father i know that well enough but i certainly did rile my father about nastasia philipovna that s very sure and that was my own doing. nastasia philipovna said the clerk as though trying to think out something. come you know nothing about her said rogojin impatiently. and supposing i do know something observed the other triumphantly. bosh there are plenty of nastasia philipovnas. and what an impertinent beast you are he added angrily. i thought some creature like you would hang on to me as soon as i got hold of my money. oh but i do know as it happens said the clerk in an aggravating manner. lebedeff knows all about her. you are pleased to reproach me your excellency but what if i prove that i am right after all nastasia philipovna s family name is barashkoff i know you see and she is a very well known lady indeed and comes of a good family too. she is connected with one totski afanasy ivanovitch a man of considerable property a director of companies and so on and a great friend of general epanchin who is interested in the same matters as he is. my eyes said rogojin really surprised at last. the devil take the fellow how does he know that why he knows everything lebedeff knows everything i was a month or two with lihachof after his father died your excellency and while he was knocking about he s in the debtor s prison now i was with him and he couldn t do a thing without lebedeff and i got to know nastasia philipovna and several people at that time. nastasia philipovna why you don t mean to say that she and lihachof cried rogojin turning quite pale. no no no no no nothing of the sort i assure you said lebedeff hastily. oh dear no not for the world totski s the only man with any chance there. oh no he takes her to his box at the opera at the french theatre of an evening and the officers and people all look at her and say by jove there s the famous nastasia philipovna but no one ever gets any further than that for there is nothing more to say. yes it s quite true said rogojin frowning gloomily so zaleshoff told me. i was walking about the nefsky one fine day prince in my father s old coat when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped into her carriage. i swear i was all of a blaze at once. then i met zaleshoff looking like a hair dresser s assistant got up as fine as i don t know who while i looked like a tinker. don t flatter yourself my boy said he she s not for such as you she s a princess she is and her name is nastasia philipovna barashkoff and she lives with totski who wishes to get rid of her because he s growing rather old fifty five or so and wants to marry a certain beauty the loveliest woman in all petersburg. and then he told me that i could see nastasia philipovna at the opera house that evening if i liked and described which was her box. well i d like to see my father allowing any of us to go to the theatre he d sooner have killed us any day. however i went for an hour or so and saw nastasia philipovna and i never slept a wink all night after. next morning my father happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell worth nearly five thousand roubles each. sell them said he and then take seven thousand five hundred roubles to the office give them to the cashier and bring me back the rest of the ten thousand without looking in anywhere on the way look sharp i shall be waiting for you. well i sold the bonds but i didn t take the seven thousand roubles to the office i went straight to the english shop and chose a pair of earrings with a diamond the size of a nut in each. they cost four hundred roubles more than i had so i gave my name and they trusted me. with the earrings i went at once to zaleshoff s. come on i said come on to nastasia philipovna s and off we went without more ado. i tell you i hadn t a notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way i saw nothing whatever. we went straight into her drawing room and then she came out to us. i didn t say right out who i was but zaleshoff said from parfen rogojin in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday be so kind as to accept these she opened the parcel looked at the earrings and laughed. thank your friend mr. rogojin for his kind attention says she and bowed and went off. why didn t i die there on the spot the worst of it all was though that the beast zaleshoff got all the credit of it i was short and abominably dressed and stood and stared in her face and never said a word because i was shy like an ass and there was he all in the fashion pomaded and dressed out with a smart tie on bowing and scraping and i bet anything she took him for me all the while look here now i said when we came out none of your interference here after this do you understand he laughed and how are you going to settle up with your father says he. i thought i might as well jump into the neva at once without going home first but it struck me that i wouldn t after all and i went home feeling like one of the damned. my goodness shivered the clerk. and his father he added for the prince s instruction and his father would have given a man a ticket to the other world for ten roubles any day not to speak of ten thousand the prince observed rogojin with great curiosity he seemed paler than ever at this moment. what do you know about it cried the latter. well my father learned the whole story at once and zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town besides. so he took me upstairs and locked me up and swore at me for an hour. this is only a foretaste says he wait a bit till night comes and i ll come back and talk to you again. well what do you think the old fellow went straight off to nastasia philipovna touched the floor with his forehead and began blubbering and beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds. so after awhile she brought the box and flew out at him. there she says take your earrings you wretched old miser although they are ten times dearer than their value to me now that i know what it must have cost parfen to get them give parfen my compliments she says and thank him very much well i meanwhile had borrowed twenty five roubles from a friend and off i went to pskoff to my aunt s. the old woman there lectured me so that i left the house and went on a drinking tour round the public houses of the place. i was in a high fever when i got to pskoff and by nightfall i was lying delirious in the streets somewhere or other oho we ll make nastasia philipovna sing another song now giggled lebedeff rubbing his hands with glee. hey my boy we ll get her some proper earrings now we ll get her such earrings that look here cried rogojin seizing him fiercely by the arm look here if you so much as name nastasia philipovna again i ll tan your hide as sure as you sit there aha do by all means if you tan my hide you won t turn me away from your society. you ll bind me to you with your lash for ever. ha ha here we are at the station though. sure enough the train was just steaming in as he spoke. though rogojin had declared that he left pskoff secretly a large collection of friends had assembled to greet him and did so with profuse waving of hats and shouting. why there s zaleshoff here too he muttered gazing at the scene with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile. then he suddenly turned to the prince prince i don t know why i have taken a fancy to you perhaps because i met you just when i did. but no it can t be that for i met this fellow nodding at lebedeff too and i have not taken a fancy to him by any means. come to see me prince we ll take off those gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat the best we can buy. you shall have a dress coat best quality white waistcoat anything you like and your pocket shall be full of money. come and you shall go with me to nastasia philipovna s. now then will you come or no accept accept prince lef nicolaievitch said lebedef solemnly don t let it slip accept quick prince muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously while he replied with some cordiality i will come with the greatest pleasure and thank you very much for taking a fancy to me. i dare say i may even come today if i have time for i tell you frankly that i like you very much too. i liked you especially when you told us about the diamond earrings but i liked you before that as well though you have such a dark clouded sort of face. thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat i certainly shall require both clothes and coat very soon. as for money i have hardly a copeck about me at this moment. you shall have lots of money by the evening i shall have plenty so come along that s true enough he ll have lots before evening put in lebedeff. but look here are you a great hand with the ladies let s know that first asked rogojin. oh no oh no said the prince i couldn t you know my illness i hardly ever saw a soul. h m well here you fellow you can come along with me now if you like cried rogojin to lebedeff and so they all left the carriage. lebedeff had his desire. he went off with the noisy group of rogojin s friends towards the voznesensky while the prince s route lay towards the litaynaya. it was damp and wet. the prince asked his way of passers by and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his destination he determined to take a droshky. ii. general epanchin lived in his own house near the litaynaya. besides this large residence five sixths of which was let in flats and lodgings the general was owner of another enormous house in the sadovaya bringing in even more rent than the first. besides these houses he had a delightful little estate just out of town and some sort of factory in another part of the city. general epanchin as everyone knew had a good deal to do with certain government monopolies he was also a voice and an important one in many rich public companies of various descriptions in fact he enjoyed the reputation of being a well to do man of busy habits many ties and affluent means. he had made himself indispensable in several quarters amongst others in his department of the government and yet it was a known fact that fedor ivanovitch epanchin was a man of no education whatever and had absolutely risen from the ranks. this last fact could of course reflect nothing but credit upon the general and yet though unquestionably a sagacious man he had his own little weaknesses very excusable ones one of which was a dislike to any allusion to the above circumstance. he was undoubtedly clever. for instance he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain more by keeping in the background and in consequence many exalted personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity and because he knew his place. and yet if these good people could only have had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who knew his place so well the fact is that in spite of his knowledge of the world and his really remarkable abilities he always liked to appear to be carrying out other people s ideas rather than his own. and also his luck seldom failed him even at cards for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to conceal. he played for high stakes and moved altogether in very varied society. as to age general epanchin was in the very prime of life that is about fifty five years of age the flowering time of existence when real enjoyment of life begins. his healthy appearance good colour sound though discoloured teeth sturdy figure preoccupied air during business hours and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the evening all bore witness to his success in life and combined to make existence a bed of roses to his excellency. the general was lord of a flourishing family consisting of his wife and three grown up daughters. he had married young while still a lieutenant his wife being a girl of about his own age who possessed neither beauty nor education and who brought him no more than fifty souls of landed property which little estate served however as a nest egg for far more important accumulations. the general never regretted his early marriage or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade and he so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her. mrs. epanchin came of the princely stock of muishkin which if not a brilliant was at all events a decidedly ancient family and she was extremely proud of her descent. with a few exceptions the worthy couple had lived through their long union very happily. while still young the wife had been able to make important friends among the aristocracy partly by virtue of her family descent and partly by her own exertions while in after life thanks to their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service she took her place among the higher circles as by right. during these last few years all three of the general s daughters alexandra adelaida and aglaya had grown up and matured. of course they were only epanchins but their mother s family was noble they might expect considerable fortunes their father had hopes of attaining to very high rank indeed in his country s service all of which was satisfactory. all three of the girls were decidedly pretty even the eldest alexandra who was just twenty five years old. the middle daughter was now twenty three while the youngest aglaya was twenty. this youngest girl was absolutely a beauty and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in society. but this was not all for every one of the three was clever well educated and accomplished. it was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very fond of one another and supported each other in every way it was even said that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake of the idol of the household aglaya. in society they not only disliked asserting themselves but were actually retiring. certainly no one could blame them for being too arrogant or haughty and yet everybody was well aware that they were proud and quite understood their own value. the eldest was musical while the second was a clever artist which fact she had concealed until lately. in a word the world spoke well of the girls but they were not without their enemies and occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had read. they were in no hurry to marry. they liked good society but were not too keen about it. all this was the more remarkable because everyone was well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents. it was about eleven o clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the bell at general epanchin s door. the general lived on the first floor or flat of the house as modest a lodging as his position permitted. a liveried servant opened the door and the prince was obliged to enter into long explanations with this gentleman who from the first glance looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion. at last however on the repeated positive assurance that he really was prince muishkin and must absolutely see the general on business the bewildered domestic showed him into a little ante chamber leading to a waiting room that adjoined the general s study there handing him over to another servant whose duty it was to be in this ante chamber all the morning and announce visitors to the general. this second individual wore a dress coat and was some forty years of age he was the general s special study servant and well aware of his own importance. wait in the next room please and leave your bundle here said the door keeper as he sat down comfortably in his own easy chair in the ante chamber. he looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter settled himself in another chair alongside with his bundle on his knees. if you don t mind i would rather sit here with you said the prince i should prefer it to sitting in there. oh but you can t stay here. you are a visitor a guest so to speak. is it the general himself you wish to see the man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby looking visitor and had decided to ask once more. yes i have business began the prince. i do not ask you what your business may be all i have to do is to announce you and unless the secretary comes in here i cannot do that. the man s suspicions seemed to increase more and more. the prince was too unlike the usual run of daily visitors and although the general certainly did receive on business all sorts and conditions of men yet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular visitor. the presence of the secretary as an intermediary was he judged essential in this case. surely you are from abroad he inquired at last in a confused sort of way. he had begun his sentence intending to say surely you are not prince muishkin are you yes straight from the train did not you intend to say surely you are not prince muishkin just now but refrained out of politeness h m grunted the astonished servant. i assure you i am not deceiving you you shall not have to answer for me. as to my being dressed like this and carrying a bundle there s nothing surprising in that the fact is my circumstances are not particularly rosy at this moment. h m no i m not afraid of that you see i have to announce you that s all. the secretary will be out directly that is unless you yes that s the rub unless you come you must allow me to ask you you ve not come to beg have you oh dear no you can be perfectly easy on that score. i have quite another matter on hand. you must excuse my asking you know. your appearance led me to think but just wait for the secretary the general is busy now but the secretary is sure to come out. oh well look here if i have some time to wait would you mind telling me is there any place about where i could have a smoke i have my pipe and tobacco with me. smoke said the man in shocked but disdainful surprise blinking his eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses. no sir you cannot smoke here and i wonder you are not ashamed of the very suggestion. ha ha a cool idea that i declare oh i didn t mean in this room i know i can t smoke here of course. i d adjourn to some other room wherever you like to show me to. you see i m used to smoking a good deal and now i haven t had a puff for three hours however just as you like. now how on earth am i to announce a man like that muttered the servant. in the first place you ve no right in here at all you ought to be in the waiting room because you re a sort of visitor a guest in fact and i shall catch it for this. look here do you intend to take up you abode with us he added glancing once more at the prince s bundle which evidently gave him no peace. no i don t think so. i don t think i should stay even if they were to invite me. i ve simply come to make their acquaintance and nothing more. make their acquaintance asked the man in amazement and with redoubled suspicion. then why did you say you had business with the general oh well very little business. there is one little matter some advice i am going to ask him for but my principal object is simply to introduce myself because i am prince muishkin and madame epanchin is the last of her branch of the house and besides herself and me there are no other muishkins left. what you re a relation then are you asked the servant so bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed. well hardly so. if you stretch a point we are relations of course but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. i once wrote to your mistress from abroad but she did not reply. however i have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. i am telling you all this in order to ease your mind for i see you are still far from comfortable on my account. all you have to do is to announce me as prince muishkin and the object of my visit will be plain enough. if i am received very good if not well very good again. but they are sure to receive me i should think madame epanchin will naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of her family. she values her muishkin descent very highly if i am rightly informed. the prince s conversation was artless and confiding to a degree and the servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common serving man this state of things was highly improper. his conclusion was that one of two things must be the explanation either that this was a begging impostor or that the prince if prince he were was simply a fool without the slightest ambition for a sensible prince with any ambition would certainly not wait about in ante rooms with servants and talk of his own private affairs like this. in either case how was he to announce this singular visitor i really think i must request you to step into the next room he said with all the insistence he could muster. why if i had been sitting there now i should not have had the opportunity of making these personal explanations. i see you are still uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle. don t you think you might go in yourself now without waiting for the secretary to come out no no i can t announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary. besides the general said he was not to be disturbed he is with the colonel c . gavrila ardalionovitch goes in without announcing. who may that be a clerk what gavrila ardalionovitch oh no he belongs to one of the companies. look here at all events put your bundle down here. yes i will if i may and can i take off my cloak of course you can t go in there with it on anyhow. the prince rose and took off his mantle revealing a neat enough morning costume a little worn but well made. he wore a steel watch chain and from this chain there hung a silver geneva watch. fool the prince might be still the general s servant felt that it was not correct for him to continue to converse thus with a visitor in spite of the fact that the prince pleased him somehow. and what time of day does the lady receive the latter asked reseating himself in his old place. oh that s not in my province i believe she receives at any time it depends upon the visitors. the dressmaker goes in at eleven. gavrila ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people too he is even admitted to early lunch now and then. it is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season observed the prince but it is much warmer there out of doors. as for the houses a russian can t live in them in the winter until he gets accustomed to them. don t they heat them at all well they do heat them a little but the houses and stoves are so different to ours. h m were you long away four years and i was in the same place nearly all the time in one village. you must have forgotten russia hadn t you yes indeed i had a good deal and would you believe it i often wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak russian even now as i talk to you i keep saying to myself how well i am speaking it. perhaps that is partly why i am so talkative this morning. i assure you ever since yesterday evening i have had the strongest desire to go on and on talking russian. h m yes did you live in petersburg in former years this good flunkey in spite of his conscientious scruples really could not resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation. in petersburg oh no hardly at all and now they say so much is changed in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged to relearn what they knew. they talk a good deal about the new law courts and changes there don t they h m yes that s true enough. well now how is the law over there do they administer it more justly than here oh i don t know about that i ve heard much that is good about our legal administration too. there is no capital punishment here for one thing. is there over there yes i saw an execution in france at lyons. schneider took me over with him to see it. what did they hang the fellow no they cut off people s heads in france. what did the fellow do yell oh no it s the work of an instant. they put a man inside a frame and a sort of broad knife falls by machinery they call the thing a guillotine it falls with fearful force and weight the head springs off so quickly that you can t wink your eye in between. but all the preparations are so dreadful. when they announce the sentence you know and prepare the criminal and tie his hands and cart him off to the scaffold that s the fearful part of the business. the people all crowd round even women though they don t at all approve of women looking on. no it s not a thing for women. of course not of course not bah the criminal was a fine intelligent fearless man le gros was his name and i may tell you believe it or not as you like that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he cried he did indeed he was as white as a bit of paper. isn t it a dreadful idea that he should have cried cried whoever heard of a grown man crying from fear not a child but a man who never had cried before a grown man of forty five years. imagine what must have been going on in that man s mind at such a moment what dreadful convulsions his whole spirit must have endured it is an outrage on the soul that s what it is. because it is said thou shalt not kill is he to be killed because he murdered some one else no it is not right it s an impossible theory. i assure you i saw the sight a month ago and it s dancing before my eyes to this moment. i dream of it often. the prince had grown animated as he spoke and a tinge of colour suffused his pale face though his way of talking was as quiet as ever. the servant followed his words with sympathetic interest. clearly he was not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end. who knows perhaps he too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for thought. well at all events it is a good thing that there s no pain when the poor fellow s head flies off he remarked. do you know though cried the prince warmly you made that remark now and everyone says the same thing and the machine is designed with the purpose of avoiding pain this guillotine i mean but a thought came into my head then what if it be a bad plan after all you may laugh at my idea perhaps but i could not help its occurring to me all the same. now with the rack and tortures and so on you suffer terrible pain of course but then your torture is bodily pain only although no doubt you have plenty of that until you die. but here i should imagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment is not the bodily pain at all but the certain knowledge that in an hour then in ten minutes then in half a minute then now this very instant your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man and that this is certain certain that s the point the certainty of it. just that instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate over your head then that quarter of a second is the most awful of all. this is not my own fantastical opinion many people have thought the same but i feel it so deeply that i ll tell you what i think. i believe that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. a murder by sentence is far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. the man who is attacked by robbers at night in a dark wood or anywhere undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death. there are plenty of instances of a man running away or imploring for mercy at all events hoping on in some degree even after his throat was cut. but in the case of an execution that last hope having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die is taken away from the wretch and certainty substituted in its place there is his sentence and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death which i consider must be the most dreadful anguish in the world. you may place a soldier before a cannon s mouth in battle and fire upon him and he will still hope. but read to that same soldier his death sentence and he will either go mad or burst into tears. who dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad no no it is an abuse a shame it is unnecessary why should such a thing exist doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced who have suffered this mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards. our lord christ spoke of this anguish and dread. no no no no man should be treated so no man no man the servant though of course he could not have expressed all this as the prince did still clearly entered into it and was greatly conciliated as was evident from the increased amiability of his expression. if you are really very anxious for a smoke he remarked i think it might possibly be managed if you are very quick about it. you see they might come out and inquire for you and you wouldn t be on the spot. you see that door there go in there and you ll find a little room on the right you can smoke there only open the window because i ought not to allow it really and . but there was no time after all. a young fellow entered the ante room at this moment with a bundle of papers in his hand. the footman hastened to help him take off his overcoat. the new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of his eyes. this gentleman declares gavrila ardalionovitch began the man confidentially and almost familiarly that he is prince muishkin and a relative of madame epanchin s. he has just arrived from abroad with nothing but a bundle by way of luggage . the prince did not hear the rest because at this point the servant continued his communication in a whisper. gavrila ardalionovitch listened attentively and gazed at the prince with great curiosity. at last he motioned the man aside and stepped hurriedly towards the prince. are you prince muishkin he asked with the greatest courtesy and amiability. he was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty eight summers fair and of middle height he wore a small beard and his face was most intelligent. yet his smile in spite of its sweetness was a little thin if i may so call it and showed his teeth too evenly his gaze though decidedly good humoured and ingenuous was a trifle too inquisitive and intent to be altogether agreeable. probably when he is alone he looks quite different and hardly smiles at all thought the prince. he explained about himself in a few words very much the same as he had told the footman and rogojin beforehand. gavrila ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall something. was it not you then who sent a letter a year or less ago from switzerland i think it was to elizabetha prokofievna mrs. epanchin it was. oh then of course they will remember who you are. you wish to see the general i ll tell him at once he will be free in a minute but you you had better wait in the ante chamber hadn t you why is he here he added severely to the man. i tell you sir he wished it himself at this moment the study door opened and a military man with a portfolio under his arm came out talking loudly and after bidding good bye to someone inside took his departure. you there gania cried a voice from the study come in here will you gavrila ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room hastily. a couple of minutes later the door opened again and the affable voice of gania cried come in please prince iii. general ivan fedorovitch epanchin was standing in the middle of the room and gazed with great curiosity at the prince as he entered. he even advanced a couple of steps to meet him. the prince came forward and introduced himself. quite so replied the general and what can i do for you oh i have no special business my principal object was to make your acquaintance. i should not like to disturb you. i do not know your times and arrangements here you see but i have only just arrived. i came straight from the station. i am come direct from switzerland. the general very nearly smiled but thought better of it and kept his smile back. then he reflected blinked his eyes stared at his guest once more from head to foot then abruptly motioned him to a chair sat down himself and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak. gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room turning over papers. i have not much time for making acquaintances as a rule said the general but as of course you have your object in coming i i felt sure you would think i had some object in view when i resolved to pay you this visit the prince interrupted but i give you my word beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance i had no personal object whatever. the pleasure is of course mutual but life is not all pleasure as you are aware. there is such a thing as business and i really do not see what possible reason there can be or what we have in common to oh there is no reason of course and i suppose there is nothing in common between us or very little for if i am prince muishkin and your wife happens to be a member of my house that can hardly be called a reason. i quite understand that. and yet that was my whole motive for coming. you see i have not been in russia for four years and knew very little about anything when i left. i had been very ill for a long time and i feel now the need of a few good friends. in fact i have a certain question upon which i much need advice and do not know whom to go to for it. i thought of your family when i was passing through berlin. they are almost relations i said to myself so i ll begin with them perhaps we may get on with each other i with them and they with me if they are kind people and i have heard that you are very kind people oh thank you thank you i m sure replied the general considerably taken aback. may i ask where you have taken up your quarters nowhere as yet. what straight from the station to my house and how about your luggage i only had a small bundle containing linen with me nothing more. i can carry it in my hand easily. there will be plenty of time to take a room in some hotel by the evening. oh then you do intend to take a room of course. to judge from your words you came straight to my house with the intention of staying there. that could only have been on your invitation. i confess however that i should not have stayed here even if you had invited me not for any particular reason but because it is well contrary to my practice and nature somehow. oh indeed then it is perhaps as well that i neither did invite you nor do invite you now. excuse me prince but we had better make this matter clear once for all. we have just agreed that with regard to our relationship there is not much to be said though of course it would have been very delightful to us to feel that such relationship did actually exist therefore perhaps therefore perhaps i had better get up and go away said the prince laughing merrily as he rose from his place just as merrily as though the circumstances were by no means strained or difficult. and i give you my word general that though i know nothing whatever of manners and customs of society and how people live and all that yet i felt quite sure that this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended now. oh well i suppose it s all right especially as my letter was not answered. well good bye and forgive me for having disturbed you the prince s expression was so good natured at this moment and so entirely free from even a suspicion of unpleasant feeling was the smile with which he looked at the general as he spoke that the latter suddenly paused and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new point of view all in an instant. do you know prince he said in quite a different tone i do not know you at all yet and after all elizabetha prokofievna would very likely be pleased to have a peep at a man of her own name. wait a little if you don t mind and if you have time to spare oh i assure you i ve lots of time my time is entirely my own and the prince immediately replaced his soft round hat on the table. i confess i thought elizabetha prokofievna would very likely remember that i had written her a letter. just now your servant outside there was dreadfully suspicious that i had come to beg of you. i noticed that probably he has very strict instructions on that score but i assure you i did not come to beg. i came to make some friends. but i am rather bothered at having disturbed you that s all i care about. look here prince said the general with a cordial smile if you really are the sort of man you appear to be it may be a source of great pleasure to us to make your better acquaintance but you see i am a very busy man and have to be perpetually sitting here and signing papers or off to see his excellency or to my department or somewhere so that though i should be glad to see more of people nice people you see i however i am sure you are so well brought up that you will see at once and but how old are you prince twenty six. no i thought you very much younger. yes they say i have a young face. as to disturbing you i shall soon learn to avoid doing that for i hate disturbing people. besides you and i are so differently constituted i should think that there must be very little in common between us. not that i will ever believe there is nothing in common between any two people as some declare is the case. i am sure people make a great mistake in sorting each other into groups by appearances but i am boring you i see you just two words have you any means at all or perhaps you may be intending to undertake some sort of employment excuse my questioning you but oh my dear sir i esteem and understand your kindness in putting the question. no at present i have no means whatever and no employment either but i hope to find some. i was living on other people abroad. schneider the professor who treated me and taught me too in switzerland gave me just enough money for my journey so that now i have but a few copecks left. there certainly is one question upon which i am anxious to have advice but tell me how do you intend to live now and what are your plans interrupted the general. i wish to work somehow or other. oh yes but then you see you are a philosopher. have you any talents or ability in any direction that is any that would bring in money and bread excuse me again oh don t apologize. no i don t think i have either talents or special abilities of any kind on the contrary. i have always been an invalid and unable to learn much. as for bread i should think the general interrupted once more with questions while the prince again replied with the narrative we have heard before. it appeared that the general had known pavlicheff but why the latter had taken an interest in the prince that young gentleman could not explain probably by virtue of the old friendship with his father he thought. the prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child and pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady a relative of his own living in the country the child needing the fresh air and exercise of country life. he was educated first by a governess and afterwards by a tutor but could not remember much about this time of his life. his fits were so frequent then that they made almost an idiot of him the prince used the expression idiot himself . pavlicheff had met professor schneider in berlin and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy to switzerland to schneider s establishment there for the cure of his epilepsy and five years before this time the prince was sent off. but pavlicheff had died two or three years since and schneider had himself supported the young fellow from that day to this at his own expense. although he had not quite cured him he had greatly improved his condition and now at last at the prince s own desire and because of a certain matter which came to the ears of the latter schneider had despatched the young man to russia. the general was much astonished. then you have no one absolutely no one in russia he asked. no one at present but i hope to make friends and then i have a letter from at all events put in the general not listening to the news about the letter at all events you must have learned something and your malady would not prevent your undertaking some easy work in one of the departments for instance oh dear no oh no as for a situation i should much like to find one for i am anxious to discover what i really am fit for. i have learned a good deal in the last four years and besides i read a great many russian books. russian books indeed then of course you can read and write quite correctly oh dear yes capital and your handwriting ah there i am really talented i may say i am a real caligraphist. let me write you something just to show you said the prince with some excitement. with pleasure in fact it is very necessary. i like your readiness prince in fact i must say i i like you very well altogether said the general. what delightful writing materials you have here such a lot of pencils and things and what beautiful paper it s a charming room altogether. i know that picture it s a swiss view. i m sure the artist painted it from nature and that i have seen the very place quite likely though i bought it here. gania give the prince some paper. here are pens and paper now then take this table. what s this the general continued to gania who had that moment taken a large photograph out of his portfolio and shown it to his senior. halloa nastasia philipovna did she send it you herself herself he inquired with much curiosity and great animation. she gave it me just now when i called in to congratulate her. i asked her for it long ago. i don t know whether she meant it for a hint that i had come empty handed without a present for her birthday or what added gania with an unpleasant smile. oh nonsense nonsense said the general with decision. what extraordinary ideas you have gania as if she would hint that s not her way at all. besides what could you give her without having thousands at your disposal you might have given her your portrait however. has she ever asked you for it no not yet. very likely she never will. i suppose you haven t forgotten about tonight have you ivan fedorovitch you were one of those specially invited you know. oh no i remember all right and i shall go of course. i should think so she s twenty five years old today and you know gania you must be ready for great things she has promised both myself and afanasy ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight yes or no. so be prepared gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than ever. are you sure she said that he asked and his voice seemed to quiver as he spoke. yes she promised. we both worried her so that she gave in but she wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day. the general watched gania s confusion intently and clearly did not like it. remember ivan fedorovitch said gania in great agitation that i was to be free too until her decision and that even then i was to have my yes or no free. why don t you aren t you began the general in alarm. oh don t misunderstand but my dear fellow what are you doing what do you mean oh i m not rejecting her. i may have expressed myself badly but i didn t mean that. reject her i should think not said the general with annoyance and apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it. why my dear fellow it s not a question of your rejecting her it is whether you are prepared to receive her consent joyfully and with proper satisfaction. how are things going on at home at home oh i can do as i like there of course only my father will make a fool of himself as usual. he is rapidly becoming a general nuisance. i don t ever talk to him now but i hold him in check safe enough. i swear if it had not been for my mother i should have shown him the way out long ago. my mother is always crying of course and my sister sulks. i had to tell them at last that i intended to be master of my own destiny and that i expect to be obeyed at home. at least i gave my sister to understand as much and my mother was present. well i must say i cannot understand it said the general shrugging his shoulders and dropping his hands. you remember your mother nina alexandrovna that day she came and sat here and groaned and when i asked her what was the matter she says oh it s such a dishonour to us dishonour stuff and nonsense i should like to know who can reproach nastasia philipovna or who can say a word of any kind against her. did she mean because nastasia had been living with totski what nonsense it is you would not let her come near your daughters says nina alexandrovna. what next i wonder i don t see how she can fail to to understand her own position prompted gania. she does understand. don t be annoyed with her. i have warned her not to meddle in other people s affairs. however although there s comparative peace at home at present the storm will break if anything is finally settled tonight. the prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation as he sat at the table writing. he finished at last and brought the result of his labour to the general s desk. so this is nastasia philipovna he said looking attentively and curiously at the portrait. how wonderfully beautiful he immediately added with warmth. the picture was certainly that of an unusually lovely woman. she was photographed in a black silk dress of simple design her hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged her eyes were deep and thoughtful the expression of her face passionate but proud. she was rather thin perhaps and a little pale. both gania and the general gazed at the prince in amazement. how do you know it s nastasia philipovna asked the general you surely don t know her already do you yes i do i have only been one day in russia but i have heard of the great beauty and the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with rogojin in the train and the whole of the latter s story. there s news said the general in some excitement after listening to the story with engrossed attention. oh of course it s nothing but humbug cried gania a little disturbed however. it s all humbug the young merchant was pleased to indulge in a little innocent recreation i have heard something of rogojin yes so have i replied the general. nastasia philipovna told us all about the earrings that very day. but now it is quite a different matter. you see the fellow really has a million of roubles and he is passionately in love. the whole story smells of passion and we all know what this class of gentry is capable of when infatuated. i am much afraid of some disagreeable scandal i am indeed you are afraid of the million i suppose said gania grinning and showing his teeth. and you are not i presume eh how did he strike you prince asked gania suddenly. did he seem to be a serious sort of a man or just a common rowdy fellow what was your own opinion about the matter while gania put this question a new idea suddenly flashed into his brain and blazed out impatiently in his eyes. the general who was really agitated and disturbed looked at the prince too but did not seem to expect much from his reply. i really don t quite know how to tell you replied the prince but it certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion and not perhaps quite healthy passion. he seemed to be still far from well. very likely he will be in bed again in a day or two especially if he lives fast. no do you think so said the general catching at the idea. yes i do think so yes but the sort of scandal i referred to may happen at any moment. it may be this very evening remarked gania to the general with a smile. of course quite so. in that case it all depends upon what is going on in her brain at this moment. you know the kind of person she is at times. how what kind of person is she cried the general arrived at the limits of his patience. look here gania don t you go annoying her tonight. what you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you can. well what are you smiling at you must understand gania that i have no interest whatever in speaking like this. whichever way the question is settled it will be to my advantage. nothing will move totski from his resolution so i run no risk. if there is anything i desire you must know that it is your benefit only. can t you trust me you are a sensible fellow and i have been counting on you for in this matter that that yes that s the chief thing said gania helping the general out of his difficulties again and curling his lips in an envenomed smile which he did not attempt to conceal. he gazed with his fevered eyes straight into those of the general as though he were anxious that the latter might read his thoughts. the general grew purple with anger. yes of course it is the chief thing he cried looking sharply at gania. what a very curious man you are gania you actually seem to be glad to hear of this millionaire fellow s arrival just as though you wished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing. this is an affair in which you ought to act honestly with both sides and give due warning to avoid compromising others. but even now there is still time. do you understand me i wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not if not say so and and welcome no one is trying to force you into the snare gavrila ardalionovitch if you see a snare in the matter at least. i do desire it murmured gania softly but firmly lowering his eyes and he relapsed into gloomy silence. the general was satisfied. he had excited himself and was evidently now regretting that he had gone so far. he turned to the prince and suddenly the disagreeable thought of the latter s presence struck him and the certainty that he must have heard every word of the conversation. but he felt at ease in another moment it only needed one glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear. oh cried the general catching sight of the prince s specimen of caligraphy which the latter had now handed him for inspection. why this is simply beautiful look at that gania there s real talent there on a sheet of thick writing paper the prince had written in medieval characters the legend the gentle abbot pafnute signed this. there explained the prince with great delight and animation there that s the abbot s real signature from a manuscript of the fourteenth century. all these old abbots and bishops used to write most beautifully with such taste and so much care and diligence. have you no copy of pogodin general if you had one i could show you another type. stop a bit here you have the large round writing common in france during the eighteenth century. some of the letters are shaped quite differently from those now in use. it was the writing current then and employed by public writers generally. i copied this from one of them and you can see how good it is. look at the well rounded a and d. i have tried to translate the french character into the russian letters a difficult thing to do but i think i have succeeded fairly. here is a fine sentence written in a good original hand zeal triumphs over all. that is the script of the russian war office. that is how official documents addressed to important personages should be written. the letters are round the type black and the style somewhat remarkable. a stylist would not allow these ornaments or attempts at flourishes just look at these unfinished tails but it has distinction and really depicts the soul of the writer. he would like to give play to his imagination and follow the inspiration of his genius but a soldier is only at ease in the guard room and the pen stops half way a slave to discipline. how delightful the first time i met an example of this handwriting i was positively astonished and where do you think i chanced to find it in switzerland of all places now that is an ordinary english hand. it can hardly be improved it is so refined and exquisite almost perfection. this is an example of another kind a mixture of styles. the copy was given me by a french commercial traveller. it is founded on the english but the downstrokes are a little blacker and more marked. notice that the oval has some slight modification it is more rounded. this writing allows for flourishes now a flourish is a dangerous thing its use requires such taste but if successful what a distinction it gives to the whole it results in an incomparable type one to fall in love with dear me how you have gone into all the refinements and details of the question why my dear fellow you are not a caligraphist you are an artist eh gania wonderful said gania. and he knows it too he added with a sarcastic smile. you may smile but there s a career in this said the general. you don t know what a great personage i shall show this to prince. why you can command a situation at thirty five roubles per month to start with. however it s half past twelve he concluded looking at his watch so to business prince for i must be setting to work and shall not see you again today. sit down a minute. i have told you that i cannot receive you myself very often but i should like to be of some assistance to you some small assistance of a kind that would give you satisfaction. i shall find you a place in one of the state departments an easy place but you will require to be accurate. now as to your plans in the house or rather in the family of gania here my young friend whom i hope you will know better his mother and sister have prepared two or three rooms for lodgers and let them to highly recommended young fellows with board and attendance. i am sure nina alexandrovna will take you in on my recommendation. there you will be comfortable and well taken care of for i do not think prince that you are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of fate in a town like petersburg. nina alexandrovna gania s mother and varvara alexandrovna are ladies for whom i have the highest possible esteem and respect. nina alexandrovna is the wife of general ardalion alexandrovitch my old brother in arms with whom i regret to say on account of certain circumstances i am no longer acquainted. i give you all this information prince in order to make it clear to you that i am personally recommending you to this family and that in so doing i am more or less taking upon myself to answer for you. the terms are most reasonable and i trust that your salary will very shortly prove amply sufficient for your expenditure. of course pocket money is a necessity if only a little do not be angry prince if i strongly recommend you to avoid carrying money in your pocket. but as your purse is quite empty at the present moment you must allow me to press these twenty five roubles upon your acceptance as something to begin with. of course we will settle this little matter another time and if you are the upright honest man you look i anticipate very little trouble between us on that score. taking so much interest in you as you may perceive i do i am not without my object and you shall know it in good time. you see i am perfectly candid with you. i hope gania you have nothing to say against the prince s taking up his abode in your house oh on the contrary my mother will be very glad said gania courteously and kindly. i think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet is it not that fellow ferd ferd ferdishenko. yes i don t like that ferdishenko. i can t understand why nastasia philipovna encourages him so. is he really her cousin as he says oh dear no it s all a joke. no more cousin than i am. well what do you think of the arrangement prince thank you general you have behaved very kindly to me all the more so since i did not ask you to help me. i don t say that out of pride. i certainly did not know where to lay my head tonight. rogojin asked me to come to his house of course but rogojin no no my good fellow. i should strongly recommend you paternally or if you prefer it as a friend to forget all about rogojin and in fact to stick to the family into which you are about to enter. thank you began the prince and since you are so very kind there is just one matter which i you must really excuse me interrupted the general but i positively haven t another moment now. i shall just tell elizabetha prokofievna about you and if she wishes to receive you at once as i shall advise her i strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the first opportunity for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in many ways. if she cannot receive you now you must be content to wait till another time. meanwhile you gania just look over these accounts will you we mustn t forget to finish off that matter the general left the room and the prince never succeeded in broaching the business which he had on hand though he had endeavoured to do so four times. gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. the latter accepted the offer but did not talk being unwilling to disturb gania s work. he commenced to examine the study and its contents. but gania hardly so much as glanced at the papers lying before him he was absent and thoughtful and his smile and general appearance struck the prince still more disagreeably now that the two were left alone together. suddenly gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over nastasia philipovna s portrait gazing at it. do you admire that sort of woman prince he asked looking intently at him. he seemed to have some special object in the question. it s a wonderful face said the prince and i feel sure that her destiny is not by any means an ordinary uneventful one. her face is smiling enough but she must have suffered terribly hasn t she her eyes show it those two bones there the little points under her eyes just where the cheek begins. it s a proud face too terribly proud and i i can t say whether she is good and kind or not. oh if she be but good that would make all well and would you marry a woman like that now continued gania never taking his excited eyes off the prince s face. i cannot marry at all said the latter. i am an invalid. would rogojin marry her do you think why not certainly he would i should think. he would marry her tomorrow marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week hardly had the prince uttered the last word when gania gave such a fearful shudder that the prince almost cried out. what s the matter said he seizing gania s hand. your highness his excellency begs your presence in her excellency s apartments announced the footman appearing at the door. the prince immediately followed the man out of the room. iv. all three of the miss epanchins were fine healthy girls well grown with good shoulders and busts and strong almost masculine hands and of course with all the above attributes they enjoyed capital appetites of which they were not in the least ashamed. elizabetha prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a little too candid in this matter but in spite of their outward deference to their mother these three young women in solemn conclave had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had been in the habit of according to her and mrs. general epanchin had judged it better to say nothing about it though of course she was well aware of the fact. it is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of reason and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient but having a respectful and well disciplined husband under her thumb at all times she found it possible as a rule to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon his head and therefore the harmony of the family was kept duly balanced and things went as smoothly as family matters can. mrs. epanchin had a fair appetite herself and generally took her share of the capital mid day lunch which was always served for the girls and which was nearly as good as a dinner. the young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal at ten o clock while still in bed. this was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. at half past twelve the table was laid in the small dining room and occasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering if he had time. besides tea and coffee cheese honey butter pan cakes of various kinds the lady of the house loved these best cutlets and so on there was generally strong beef soup and other substantial delicacies. on the particular morning on which our story has opened the family had assembled in the dining room and were waiting the general s appearance the latter having promised to come this day. if he had been one moment late he would have been sent for at once but he turned up punctually. as he came forward to wish his wife good morning and kiss her hands as his custom was he observed something in her look which boded ill. he thought he knew the reason and had expected it but still he was not altogether comfortable. his daughters advanced to kiss him too and though they did not look exactly angry there was something strange in their expression as well. the general was owing to certain circumstances a little inclined to be too suspicious at home and needlessly nervous but as an experienced father and husband he judged it better to take measures at once to protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air. however i hope i shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my narrative too much if i diverge for a moment at this point in order to explain the mutual relations between general epanchin s family and others acting a part in this history at the time when we take up the thread of their destiny. i have already stated that the general though he was a man of lowly origin and of poor education was for all that an experienced and talented husband and father. among other things he considered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial altar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes for their happiness as is the custom among parents of many grown up daughters. he even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this question though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish because unnatural but the general s arguments were conclusive and founded upon obvious facts. the general considered that the girls taste and good sense should be allowed to develop and mature deliberately and that the parents duty should merely be to keep watch in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made but that the selection once effected both father and mother were bound from that moment to enter heart and soul into the cause and to see that the matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily reached. besides this it was clear that the epanchins position gained each year with geometrical accuracy both as to financial solidity and social weight and therefore the longer the girls waited the better was their chance of making a brilliant match. but again amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded one more equally significant rose up to confront the family and this was that the eldest daughter alexandra had imperceptibly arrived at her twenty fifth birthday. almost at the same moment afanasy ivanovitch totski a man of immense wealth high connections and good standing announced his intention of marrying. afanasy ivanovitch was a gentleman of fifty five years of age artistically gifted and of most refined tastes. he wished to marry well and moreover he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty. now since totski had of late been upon terms of great cordiality with epanchin which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were so to speak partners in several financial enterprises it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated. might he suggest for instance such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the general s daughters evidently the quiet pleasant current of the family life of the epanchins was about to undergo a change. the undoubted beauty of the family par excellence was the youngest aglaya as aforesaid. but totski himself though an egotist of the extremest type realized that he had no chance there aglaya was clearly not for such as he. perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or less exaggerated aglaya s chances of happiness. in their opinion the latter s destiny was not merely to be very happy she was to live in a heaven on earth. aglaya s husband was to be a compendium of all the virtues and of all success not to speak of fabulous wealth. the two elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them if need be for aglaya s sake her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented. the general and his wife were aware of this agreement and therefore when totski suggested himself for one of the sisters the parents made no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the offer since totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. the general valued the proposal very highly. he knew life and realized what such an offer was worth. the answer of the sisters to the communication was if not conclusive at least consoling and hopeful. it made known that the eldest alexandra would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal. alexandra was a good natured girl though she had a will of her own. she was intelligent and kind hearted and if she were to marry totski she would make him a good wife. she did not care for a brilliant marriage she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life of any man decidedly pretty if not absolutely handsome. what better could totski wish so the matter crept slowly forward. the general and totski had agreed to avoid any hasty and irrevocable step. alexandra s parents had not even begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject when suddenly as it were a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the proceedings. mrs. epanchin began to show signs of discontent and that was a serious matter. a certain circumstance had crept in a disagreeable and troublesome factor which threatened to overturn the whole business. this circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. close to an estate of totski s in one of the central provinces of russia there lived at that time a poor gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest description. this gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent ill fortune his name was barashkoff and as regards family and descent he was vastly superior to totski but his estate was mortgaged to the last acre. one day when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor the chief peasant of his village followed him shortly after with the news that his house had been burnt down and that his wife had perished with it but his children were safe. even barashkoff inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was could not stand this last stroke. he went mad and died shortly after in the town hospital. his estate was sold for the creditors and the little girls two of them of seven and eight years of age respectively were adopted by totski who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness of his heart. they were brought up together with the children of his german bailiff. very soon however there was only one of them left nastasia philipovna for the other little one died of whooping cough. totski who was living abroad at this time very soon forgot all about the child but five years after returning to russia it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there and arrived at his bailiff s house he was not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve sweet and intelligent and bright and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality as to which last totski was an undoubted authority. he only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion but he had time to make his arrangements. great changes took place in the child s education a good governess was engaged a swiss lady of experience and culture. for four years this lady resided in the house with little nastia and then the education was considered complete. the governess took her departure and another lady came down to fetch nastia by totski s instructions. the child was now transported to another of totski s estates in a distant part of the country. here she found a delightful little house just built and prepared for her reception with great care and taste and here she took up her abode together with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home. in the house there were two experienced maids musical instruments of all sorts a charming young lady s library pictures paint boxes a lap dog and everything to make life agreeable. within a fortnight totski himself arrived and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer staying two and three months at a time. so passed four years peacefully and happily in charming surroundings. at the end of that time and about four months after totski s last visit he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion a report reached nastasia philipovna that he was about to be married in st. petersburg to a rich eminent and lovely woman. the report was only partially true the marriage project being only in an embryo condition but a great change now came over nastasia philipovna. she suddenly displayed unusual decision of character and without wasting time in thought she left her country home and came up to st. petersburg straight to totski s house all alone. the latter amazed at her conduct began to express his displeasure but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice style and everything else with this young lady the good old times were gone. an entirely new and different woman sat before him between whom and the girl he had left in the country last july there seemed nothing in common. in the first place this new woman understood a good deal more than was usual for young people of her age so much indeed that totski could not help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. surely not from her young lady s library it even embraced legal matters and the world in general to a considerable extent. her character was absolutely changed. no more of the girlish alternations of timidity and petulance the adorable naivete the reveries the tears the playfulness... it was an entirely new and hitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him and informed him to his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any kind except loathing and contempt contempt which had followed closely upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first acquaintance with him. this new woman gave him further to understand that though it was absolutely the same to her whom he married yet she had decided to prevent this marriage for no particular reason but that she chose to do so and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it was quite her turn to laugh a little now such were her words very likely she did not give her real reason for this eccentric conduct but at all events that was all the explanation she deigned to offer. meanwhile totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas would permit. his meditations lasted a fortnight however and at the end of that time his resolution was taken. the fact was totski was at that time a man of fifty years of age his position was solid and respectable his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe foundations he loved himself his personal comforts and his position better than all the world as every respectable gentleman should at the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed totski that he now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the ordinary rules of traditional behaviour and who would not only threaten mischief but would undoubtedly carry it out and stop for no one. there was evidently he concluded something at work here some storm of the mind some paroxysm of romantic anger goodness knows against whom or what some insatiable contempt in a word something altogether absurd and impossible but at the same time most dangerous to be met with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up. for a man of totski s wealth and standing it would of course have been the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at once from all annoyance while it was obviously impossible for nastasia philipovna to harm him in any way either legally or by stirring up a scandal for in case of the latter danger he could so easily remove her to a sphere of safety. however these arguments would only hold good in case of nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency. she was much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct by some extraordinary eccentricity. here the sound judgment of totski stood him in good stead. he realized that nastasia philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing by legal means to injure him and that her flashing eyes betrayed some entirely different intention. nastasia philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself and even of perpetrating something which would send her to siberia for the mere pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a sense of loathing and contempt. he had sufficient insight to understand that she valued nothing in the world herself least of all and he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects. for instance if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the altar or publicly insulted he would undoubtedly have been frightened but not so much at the idea of being murdered or wounded or insulted as at the thought that if such things were to happen he would be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of society. he knew well that nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound him and how and therefore as the marriage was still only in embryo totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. his decision was strengthened by the fact that nastasia philipovna had curiously altered of late. it would be difficult to conceive how different she was physically at the present time to the girl of a few years ago. she was pretty then... but now ... totski laughed angrily when he thought how short sighted he had been. in days gone by he remembered how he had looked at her beautiful eyes how even then he had marvelled at their dark mysterious depths and at their wondering gaze which seemed to seek an answer to some unknown riddle. her complexion also had altered. she was now exceedingly pale but curiously this change only made her more beautiful. like most men of the world totski had rather despised such a cheaply bought conquest but of late years he had begun to think differently about it. it had struck him as long ago as last spring that he ought to be finding a good match for nastasia for instance some respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office in another part of the country. how maliciously nastasia laughed at the idea of such a thing now however it appeared to totski that he might make use of her in another way and he determined to establish her in st. petersburg surrounding her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command. in this way he might gain glory in certain circles. five years of this petersburg life went by and of course during that time a great deal happened. totski s position was very uncomfortable having funked once he could not totally regain his ease. he was afraid he did not know why but he was simply afraid of nastasia philipovna. for the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to marry him herself and that only her vanity prevented her telling him so. he thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal from his own side. but to his great and not entirely pleasurable amazement he discovered that this was by no means the case and that were he to offer himself he would be refused. he could not understand such a state of things and was obliged to conclude that it was pride the pride of an injured and imaginative woman which had gone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt and hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable splendour. to make matters worse she was quite impervious to mercenary considerations and could not be bribed in any way. finally totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be free. he tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart he invited princes hussars secretaries of embassies poets novelists even socialists to see her but not one of them all made the faintest impression upon nastasia. it was as though she had a pebble in place of a heart as though her feelings and affections were dried up and withered for ever. she lived almost entirely alone she read she studied she loved music. her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades a couple of actresses and the family of a poor schoolteacher. among these people she was much beloved. she received four or five friends sometimes of an evening. totski often came. lately too general epanchin had been enabled with great difficulty to introduce himself into her circle. gania made her acquaintance also and others were ferdishenko an ill bred and would be witty young clerk and ptitsin a money lender of modest and polished manners who had risen from poverty. in fact nastasia philipovna s beauty became a thing known to all the town but not a single man could boast of anything more than his own admiration for her and this reputation of hers and her wit and culture and grace all confirmed totski in the plan he had now prepared. and it was at this moment that general epanchin began to play so large and important a part in the story. when totski had approached the general with his request for friendly counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters he had made a full and candid confession. he had said that he intended to stop at no means to obtain his freedom even if nastasia were to promise to leave him entirely alone in future he would not he said believe and trust her words were not enough for him he must have solid guarantees of some sort. so he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect. having arrived at nastasia s house one day with epanchin totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of his position. he admitted that he was to blame for all but candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse for his original guilt towards herself because he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and ineradicable and that he had no power over himself in this respect but that he wished seriously to marry at last and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which he contemplated was in her hands in a word he confided his all to her generosity of heart. general epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father of a family he spoke sensibly and without wasting words over any attempt at sentimentality he merely recorded his full admission of her right to be the arbiter of totski s destiny at this moment. he then pointed out that the fate of his daughter and very likely of both his other daughters now hung upon her reply. to nastasia s question as to what they wished her to do totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her five years ago that he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married. he immediately added that such a suggestion from him would of course be absurd unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. he very well knew he said that a certain young gentleman of good family namely gavrila ardalionovitch ivolgin with whom she was acquainted and whom she received at her house had long loved her passionately and would give his life for some response from her. the young fellow had confessed this love of his to him totski and had also admitted it in the hearing of his benefactor general epanchin. lastly he could not help being of opinion that nastasia must be aware of gania s love for her and if he totski mistook not she had looked with some favour upon it being often lonely and rather tired of her present life. having remarked how difficult it was for him of all people to speak to her of these matters totski concluded by saying that he trusted nastasia philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of seventy five thousand roubles. he added that the sum would have been left her all the same in his will and that therefore she must not consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything but that there was no reason after all why a man should not be allowed to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience etc. etc. in fact all that would naturally be said under the circumstances. totski was very eloquent all through and in conclusion just touched on the fact that not a soul in the world not even general epanchin had ever heard a word about the above seventy five thousand roubles and that this was the first time he had ever given expression to his intentions in respect to them. nastasia philipovna s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the friends considerably. not only was there no trace of her former irony of her old hatred and enmity and of that dreadful laughter the very recollection of which sent a cold chill down totski s back to this very day but she seemed charmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously with him for once in a way. she confessed that she had long wished to have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice but that pride had hitherto prevented her now however that the ice was broken nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity. first with a sad smile and then with a twinkle of merriment in her eyes she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now quite out of the question. she said that she had long since changed her views of things and recognized that facts must be taken into consideration in spite of the feelings of the heart. what was done was done and ended and she could not understand why totski should still feel alarmed. she next turned to general epanchin and observed most courteously that she had long since known of his daughters and that she had heard none but good report that she had learned to think of them with deep and sincere respect. the idea alone that she could in any way serve them would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness. it was true that she was lonely in her present life totski had judged her thoughts aright. she longed to rise if not to love at least to family life and new hopes and objects but as to gavrila ardalionovitch she could not as yet say much. she thought it must be the case that he loved her she felt that she too might learn to love him if she could be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself but he was very young and it was a difficult question to decide. what she specially liked about him was that he worked and supported his family by his toil. she had heard that he was proud and ambitious she had heard much that was interesting of his mother and sister she had heard of them from mr. ptitsin and would much like to make their acquaintance but another question would they like to receive her into their house at all events though she did not reject the idea of this marriage she desired not to be hurried. as for the seventy five thousand roubles mr. totski need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the matter she quite understood the value of money and would of course accept the gift. she thanked him for his delicacy however but saw no reason why gavrila ardalionovitch should not know about it. she would not marry the latter she said until she felt persuaded that neither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any sort of concealed suspicions as to herself. she did not intend to ask forgiveness for anything in the past which fact she desired to be known. she did not consider herself to blame for anything that had happened in former years and she thought that gavrila ardalionovitch should be informed as to the relations which had existed between herself and totski during the last five years. if she accepted this money it was not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young girl which had not been in any degree her own fault but merely as compensation for her ruined life. she became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and confessions that general epanchin was highly gratified and considered the matter satisfactorily arranged once for all. but the once bitten totski was twice shy and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers. however the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted to bring about their object namely gania s attractiveness for nastasia philipovna stood out more and more prominently the pourparlers had commenced and gradually even totski began to believe in the possibility of success. before long nastasia and gania had talked the matter over. very little was said her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of discussing such a question. but she recognized his love on the understanding that she bound herself to nothing whatever and that she reserved the right to say no up to the very hour of the marriage ceremony. gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last moment. it soon became clear to gania after scenes of wrath and quarrellings at the domestic hearth that his family were seriously opposed to the match and that nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident. she said nothing about it though he daily expected her to do so. there were several rumours afloat before long which upset totski s equanimity a good deal but we will not now stop to describe them merely mentioning an instance or two. one was that nastasia had entered into close and secret relations with the epanchin girls a most unlikely rumour another was that nastasia had long satisfied herself of the fact that gania was merely marrying her for money and that his nature was gloomy and greedy impatient and selfish to an extraordinary degree and that although he had been keen enough in his desire to achieve a conquest before yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his passion for their own purposes it was clear enough that he had begun to consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare. in his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway and although he had at last given his consent to marry the woman as he said under the stress of circumstances yet he promised himself that he would take it out of her after marriage. nastasia seemed to totski to have divined all this and to be preparing something on her own account which frightened him to such an extent that he did not dare communicate his views even to the general. but at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again acting in fact as weak men do act in such circumstances. however both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when one day nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on the evening of her birthday which anniversary was due in a very short time. a strange rumour began to circulate meanwhile no less than that the respectable and highly respected general epanchin was himself so fascinated by nastasia philipovna that his feeling for her amounted almost to passion. what he thought to gain by gania s marriage to the girl it was difficult to imagine. possibly he counted on gania s complaisance for totski had long suspected that there existed some secret understanding between the general and his secretary. at all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for nastasia s birthday and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. the day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation. mrs. epanchin long accustomed to her husband s infidelities had heard of the pearls and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest. the general remarked her suspicions and felt that a grand explanation must shortly take place which fact alarmed him much. this is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch on the morning upon which we took up this narrative with the rest of his family. before the prince s arrival he had made up his mind to plead business and cut the meal which simply meant running away. he was particularly anxious that this one day should be passed especially the evening without unpleasantness between himself and his family and just at the right moment the prince turned up as though heaven had sent him on purpose said the general to himself as he left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom. v. mrs. general epanchin was a proud woman by nature. what must her feelings have been when she heard that prince muishkin the last of his and her line had arrived in beggar s guise a wretched idiot a recipient of charity all of which details the general gave out for greater effect he was anxious to steal her interest at the first swoop so as to distract her thoughts from other matters nearer home. mrs. epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight and staring before her without speaking in moments of excitement. she was a fine woman of the same age as her husband with a slightly hooked nose a high narrow forehead thick hair turning a little grey and a sallow complexion. her eyes were grey and wore a very curious expression at times. she believed them to be most effective a belief that nothing could alter. what receive him now at once asked mrs. epanchin gazing vaguely at her husband as he stood fidgeting before her. oh dear me i assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with him the general explained hastily. he is quite a child not to say a pathetic looking creature. he has fits of some sort and has just arrived from switzerland straight from the station dressed like a german and without a farthing in his pocket. i gave him twenty five roubles to go on with and am going to find him some easy place in one of the government offices. i should like you to ply him well with the victuals my dears for i should think he must be very hungry. you astonish me said the lady gazing as before. fits and hungry too what sort of fits oh they don t come on frequently besides he s a regular child though he seems to be fairly educated. i should like you if possible my dears the general added making slowly for the door to put him through his paces a bit and see what he is good for. i think you should be kind to him it is a good deed you know however just as you like of course but he is a sort of relation remember and i thought it might interest you to see the young fellow seeing that this is so. oh of course mamma if we needn t stand on ceremony with him we must give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey especially as he has not the least idea where to go to said alexandra the eldest of the girls. besides he s quite a child we can entertain him with a little hide and seek in case of need said adelaida. hide and seek what do you mean inquired mrs. epanchin. oh do stop pretending mamma cried aglaya in vexation. send him up father mother allows. the general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be shown in. only on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch then said mrs. epanchin and let fedor or mavra stand behind him while he eats. is he quiet when he has these fits he doesn t show violence does he on the contrary he seems to be very well brought up. his manners are excellent but here he is himself. here you are prince let me introduce you the last of the muishkins a relative of your own my dear or at least of the same name. receive him kindly please. they ll bring in lunch directly prince you must stop and have some but you must excuse me. i m in a hurry i must be off we all know where you must be off to said mrs. epanchin in a meaning voice. yes yes i must hurry away i m late look here dears let him write you something in your albums you ve no idea what a wonderful caligraphist he is wonderful talent he has just written out abbot pafnute signed this for me. well au revoir stop a minute where are you off to who is this abbot cried mrs. epanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of excited annoyance. yes my dear it was an old abbot of that name i must be off to see the count he s waiting for me i m late good bye au revoir prince and the general bolted at full speed. oh yes i know what count you re going to see remarked his wife in a cutting manner as she turned her angry eyes on the prince. now then what s all this about what abbot who s pafnute she added brusquely. mamma said alexandra shocked at her rudeness. aglaya stamped her foot. nonsense let me alone said the angry mother. now then prince sit down here no nearer come nearer the light i want to have a good look at you. so now then who is this abbot abbot pafnute said our friend seriously and with deference. pafnute yes. and who was he mrs. epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely and when the prince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said. the abbot pafnute lived in the fourteenth century began the prince he was in charge of one of the monasteries on the volga about where our present kostroma government lies. he went to oreol and helped in the great matters then going on in the religious world he signed an edict there and i have seen a print of his signature it struck me so i copied it. when the general asked me in his study to write something for him to show my handwriting i wrote the abbot pafnute signed this in the exact handwriting of the abbot. the general liked it very much and that s why he recalled it just now. aglaya make a note of pafnute or we shall forget him. h m and where is this signature i think it was left on the general s table. let it be sent for at once oh i ll write you a new one in half a minute said the prince if you like of course mamma said alexandra. but let s have lunch now we are all hungry yes come along prince said the mother are you very hungry yes i must say that i am pretty hungry thanks very much. h m i like to see that you know your manners and you are by no means such a person as the general thought fit to describe you. come along you sit here opposite to me she continued i wish to be able to see your face. alexandra adelaida look after the prince he doesn t seem so very ill does he i don t think he requires a napkin under his chin after all are you accustomed to having one on prince formerly when i was seven years old or so. i believe i wore one but now i usually hold my napkin on my knee when i eat. of course of course and about your fits fits asked the prince slightly surprised. i very seldom have fits nowadays. i don t know how it may be here though they say the climate may be bad for me. he talks very well you know said mrs. epanchin who still continued to nod at each word the prince spoke. i really did not expect it at all in fact i suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the general s part as usual. eat away prince and tell me where you were born and where you were brought up. i wish to know all about you you interest me very much the prince expressed his thanks once more and eating heartily the while recommenced the narrative of his life in switzerland all of which we have heard before. mrs. epanchin became more and more pleased with her guest the girls too listened with considerable attention. in talking over the question of relationship it turned out that the prince was very well up in the matter and knew his pedigree off by heart. it was found that scarcely any connection existed between himself and mrs. epanchin but the talk and the opportunity of conversing about her family tree gratified the latter exceedingly and she rose from the table in great good humour. let s all go to my boudoir she said and they shall bring some coffee in there. that s the room where we all assemble and busy ourselves as we like best she explained. alexandra my eldest here plays the piano or reads or sews adelaida paints landscapes and portraits but never finishes any and aglaya sits and does nothing. i don t work too much either. here we are now sit down prince near the fire and talk to us. i want to hear you relate something. i wish to make sure of you first and then tell my old friend princess bielokonski about you. i wish you to know all the good people and to interest them. now then begin mamma it s rather a strange order that said adelaida who was fussing among her paints and paint brushes at the easel. aglaya and alexandra had settled themselves with folded hands on a sofa evidently meaning to be listeners. the prince felt that the general attention was concentrated upon himself. i should refuse to say a word if i were ordered to tell a story like that observed aglaya. why what s there strange about it he has a tongue. why shouldn t he tell us something i want to judge whether he is a good story teller anything you like prince how you liked switzerland what was your first impression anything. you ll see he ll begin directly and tell us all about it beautifully. the impression was forcible the prince began. there you see girls said the impatient lady he has begun you see. well then let him talk mamma said alexandra. this prince is a great humbug and by no means an idiot she whispered to aglaya. oh i saw that at once replied the latter. i don t think it at all nice of him to play a part. what does he wish to gain by it i wonder my first impression was a very strong one repeated the prince. when they took me away from russia i remember i passed through many german towns and looked out of the windows but did not trouble so much as to ask questions about them. this was after a long series of fits. i always used to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series and lost my memory almost entirely and though i was not altogether without reason at such times yet i had no logical power of thought. this would continue for three or four days and then i would recover myself again. i remember my melancholy was intolerable i felt inclined to cry i sat and wondered and wondered uncomfortably the consciousness that everything was strange weighed terribly upon me i could understand that it was all foreign and strange. i recollect i awoke from this state for the first time at basle one evening the bray of a donkey aroused me a donkey in the town market. i saw the donkey and was extremely pleased with it and from that moment my head seemed to clear. a donkey how strange yet it is not strange. anyone of us might fall in love with a donkey it happened in mythological times said madame epanchin looking wrathfully at her daughters who had begun to laugh. go on prince. since that evening i have been specially fond of donkeys. i began to ask questions about them for i had never seen one before and i at once came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of animals strong willing patient cheap and thanks to this donkey i began to like the whole country i was travelling through and my melancholy passed away. all this is very strange and interesting said mrs. epanchin. now let s leave the donkey and go on to other matters. what are you laughing at aglaya and you too adelaida the prince told us his experiences very cleverly he saw the donkey himself and what have you ever seen you have never been abroad. i have seen a donkey though mamma said aglaya. and i ve heard one said adelaida. all three of the girls laughed out loud and the prince laughed with them. well it s too bad of you said mamma. you must forgive them prince they are good girls. i am very fond of them though i often have to be scolding them they are all as silly and mad as march hares. oh why shouldn t they laugh said the prince. i shouldn t have let the chance go by in their place i know. but i stick up for the donkey all the same he s a patient good natured fellow. are you a patient man prince i ask out of curiosity said mrs. epanchin. all laughed again. oh that wretched donkey again i see cried the lady. i assure you prince i was not guilty of the least insinuation oh i assure you i take your word for it. and the prince continued laughing merrily. i must say it s very nice of you to laugh. i see you really are a kind hearted fellow said mrs. epanchin. i m not always kind though. i am kind myself and always kind too if you please she retorted unexpectedly and that is my chief fault for one ought not to be always kind. i am often angry with these girls and their father but the worst of it is i am always kindest when i am cross. i was very angry just before you came and aglaya there read me a lesson thanks aglaya dear come and kiss me there that s enough she added as aglaya came forward and kissed her lips and then her hand. now then go on prince. perhaps you can think of something more exciting than about the donkey eh i must say again i can t understand how you can expect anyone to tell you stories straight away so said adelaida. i know i never could yes but the prince can because he is clever cleverer than you are by ten or twenty times if you like. there that s so prince and seriously let s drop the donkey now what else did you see abroad besides the donkey yes but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly all the same said alexandra. i have always been most interested to hear how people go mad and get well again and that sort of thing. especially when it happens suddenly. quite so quite so cried mrs. epanchin delighted. i see you can be sensible now and then alexandra. you were speaking of switzerland prince yes. we came to lucerne and i was taken out in a boat. i felt how lovely it was but the loveliness weighed upon me somehow or other and made me feel melancholy. why asked alexandra. i don t know i always feel like that when i look at the beauties of nature for the first time but then i was ill at that time of course oh but i should like to see it said adelaida and i don t know when we shall ever go abroad. i ve been two years looking out for a good subject for a picture. i ve done all i know. the north and south i know by heart as our poet observes. do help me to a subject prince. oh but i know nothing about painting. it seems to me one only has to look and paint what one sees. but i don t know how to see nonsense what rubbish you talk the mother struck in. not know how to see open your eyes and look if you can t see here you won t see abroad either. tell us what you saw yourself prince yes that s better said adelaida the prince learned to see abroad. oh i hardly know you see i only went to restore my health. i don t know whether i learned to see exactly. i was very happy however nearly all the time. happy you can be happy cried aglaya. then how can you say you did not learn to see i should think you could teach us to see oh do teach us laughed adelaida. oh i can t do that said the prince laughing too. i lived almost all the while in one little swiss village what can i teach you at first i was only just not absolutely dull then my health began to improve then every day became dearer and more precious to me and the longer i stayed the dearer became the time to me so much so that i could not help observing it but why this was so it would be difficult to say. so that you didn t care to go away anywhere else well at first i did i was restless i didn t know however i should manage to support life you know there are such moments especially in solitude. there was a waterfall near us such a lovely thin streak of water like a thread but white and moving. it fell from a great height but it looked quite low and it was half a mile away though it did not seem fifty paces. i loved to listen to it at night but it was then that i became so restless. sometimes i went and climbed the mountain and stood there in the midst of the tall pines all alone in the terrible silence with our little village in the distance and the sky so blue and the sun so bright and an old ruined castle on the mountain side far away. i used to watch the line where earth and sky met and longed to go and seek there the key of all mysteries thinking that i might find there a new life perhaps some great city where life should be grander and richer and then it struck me that life may be grand enough even in a prison. i read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual when i was twelve years old said aglaya. all this is pure philosophy said adelaida. you are a philosopher prince and have come here to instruct us in your views. perhaps you are right said the prince smiling. i think i am a philosopher perhaps and who knows perhaps i do wish to teach my views of things to those i meet with your philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we know who is rich and yet does nothing but try how little she can spend. she talks of nothing but money all day. your great philosophical idea of a grand life in a prison and your four happy years in that swiss village are like this rather said aglaya. as to life in a prison of course there may be two opinions said the prince. i once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a prison i heard it from the man himself. he was one of the persons under treatment with my professor he had fits and attacks of melancholy then he would weep and once he tried to commit suicide. his life in prison was sad enough his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating but i think i had better tell you of another man i met last year. there was a very strange feature in this case strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. this man had once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others and had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime. twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment substituted but the interval between the two sentences twenty minutes or at least a quarter of an hour had been passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. i was very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time and i several times inquired of him as to what he thought and felt. he remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary distinctness and declared that he would never forget a single iota of the experience. about twenty paces from the scaffold where he had stood to hear the sentence were three posts fixed in the ground to which to fasten the criminals of whom there were several . the first three criminals were taken to the posts dressed in long white tunics with white caps drawn over their faces so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them. then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. my friend was the eighth on the list and therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up. a priest went about among them with a cross and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live. he said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable period an enormous wealth of time he seemed to be living in these minutes so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last moment so that he made several arrangements dividing up the time into portions one for saying farewell to his companions two minutes for that then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all about himself and another minute for a last look around. he remembered having divided his time like this quite well. while saying good bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday question and being much interested in the answer. then having bade farewell he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself he knew beforehand what he was going to think about. he wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible that here was he a living thinking man and that in three minutes he would be nobody or if somebody or something then what and where he thought he would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes. a little way off there stood a church and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. he remembered staring stubbornly at this spire and at the rays of light sparkling from it. he could not tear his eyes from these rays of light he got the idea that these rays were his new nature and that in three minutes he would become one of them amalgamated somehow with them. the repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately and the uncertainty were dreadful he said but worst of all was the idea what should i do if i were not to die now what if i were to return to life again what an eternity of days and all mine how i should grudge and count up every minute of it so as to waste not a single instant he said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done with it. the prince paused and all waited expecting him to go on again and finish the story. is that all asked aglaya. all yes said the prince emerging from a momentary reverie. and why did you tell us this oh i happened to recall it that s all it fitted into the conversation you probably wish to deduce prince said alexandra that moments of time cannot be reckoned by money value and that sometimes five minutes are worth priceless treasures. all this is very praiseworthy but may i ask about this friend of yours who told you the terrible experience of his life he was reprieved you say in other words they did restore to him that eternity of days. what did he do with these riches of time did he keep careful account of his minutes oh no he didn t i asked him myself. he said that he had not lived a bit as he had intended and had wasted many and many a minute. very well then there s an experiment and the thing is proved one cannot live and count each moment say what you like but one cannot . that is true said the prince i have thought so myself. and yet why shouldn t one do it you think then that you could live more wisely than other people said aglaya. i have had that idea. and you have it still yes i have it still the prince replied. he had contemplated aglaya until now with a pleasant though rather timid smile but as the last words fell from his lips he began to laugh and looked at her merrily. you are not very modest said she. but how brave you are said he. you are laughing and i that man s tale impressed me so much that i dreamt of it afterwards yes i dreamt of those five minutes... he looked at his listeners again with that same serious searching expression. you are not angry with me he asked suddenly and with a kind of nervous hurry although he looked them straight in the face. why should we be angry they cried. only because i seem to be giving you a lecture all the time at this they laughed heartily. please don t be angry with me continued the prince. i know very well that i have seen less of life than other people and have less knowledge of it. i must appear to speak strangely sometimes... he said the last words nervously. you say you have been happy and that proves you have lived not less but more than other people. why make all these excuses interrupted aglaya in a mocking tone of voice. besides you need not mind about lecturing us you have nothing to boast of. with your quietism one could live happily for a hundred years at least. one might show you the execution of a felon or show you one s little finger. you could draw a moral from either and be quite satisfied. that sort of existence is easy enough. i can t understand why you always fly into a temper said mrs. epanchin who had been listening to the conversation and examining the faces of the speakers in turn. i do not understand what you mean. what has your little finger to do with it the prince talks well though he is not amusing. he began all right but now he seems sad. never mind mamma prince i wish you had seen an execution said aglaya. i should like to ask you a question about that if you had. i have seen an execution said the prince. you have cried aglaya. i might have guessed it. that s a fitting crown to the rest of the story. if you have seen an execution how can you say you lived happily all the while but is there capital punishment where you were asked adelaida. i saw it at lyons. schneider took us there and as soon as we arrived we came in for that. well and did you like it very much was it very edifying and instructive asked aglaya. no i didn t like it at all and was ill after seeing it but i confess i stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight. i could not tear them away. i too should have been unable to tear my eyes away said aglaya. they do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there. the women who do go are condemned for it afterwards in the newspapers. that is by contending that it is not a sight for women they admit that it is a sight for men. i congratulate them on the deduction. i suppose you quite agree with them prince tell us about the execution put in adelaida. i would much rather not just now said the prince a little disturbed and frowning slightly. you don t seem to want to tell us said aglaya with a mocking air. no the thing is i was telling all about the execution a little while ago and whom did you tell about it the man servant while i was waiting to see the general. our man servant exclaimed several voices at once. yes the one who waits in the entrance hall a greyish red faced man the prince is clearly a democrat remarked aglaya. well if you could tell aleksey about it surely you can tell us too. i do so want to hear about it repeated adelaida. just now i confess began the prince with more animation when you asked me for a subject for a picture i confess i had serious thoughts of giving you one. i thought of asking you to draw the face of a criminal one minute before the fall of the guillotine while the wretched man is still standing on the scaffold preparatory to placing his neck on the block. what his face only his face asked adelaida. that would be a strange subject indeed. and what sort of a picture would that make oh why not the prince insisted with some warmth. when i was in basle i saw a picture very much in that style i should like to tell you about it i will some time or other it struck me very forcibly. oh you shall tell us about the basle picture another time now we must have all about the execution said adelaida. tell us about that face as it appeared to your imagination how should it be drawn just the face alone do you mean it was just a minute before the execution began the prince readily carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything else in a moment just at the instant when he stepped off the ladder on to the scaffold. he happened to look in my direction i saw his eyes and understood all at once but how am i to describe it i do so wish you or somebody else could draw it you if possible. i thought at the time what a picture it would make. you must imagine all that went before of course all all. he had lived in the prison for some time and had not expected that the execution would take place for at least a week yet he had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time but it so happened that his papers had been got ready quickly. at five o clock in the morning he was asleep it was october and at five in the morning it was cold and dark. the governor of the prison comes in on tip toe and touches the sleeping man s shoulder gently. he starts up. what is it he says. the execution is fixed for ten o clock. he was only just awake and would not believe at first but began to argue that his papers would not be out for a week and so on. when he was wide awake and realized the truth he became very silent and argued no more so they say but after a bit he said it comes very hard on one so suddenly and then he was silent again and said nothing. the three or four hours went by of course in necessary preparations the priest breakfast coffee meat and some wine they gave him doesn t it seem ridiculous and yet i believe these people give them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart and believe that they are doing a good action. then he is dressed and then begins the procession through the town to the scaffold. i think he too must feel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along. probably he thought on the way oh i have a long long time yet. three streets of life yet when we ve passed this street there ll be that other one and then that one where the baker s shop is on the right and when shall we get there it s ages ages around him are crowds shouting yelling ten thousand faces twenty thousand eyes. all this has to be endured and especially the thought here are ten thousand men and not one of them is going to be executed and yet i am to die. well all that is preparatory. at the scaffold there is a ladder and just there he burst into tears and this was a strong man and a terribly wicked one they say there was a priest with him the whole time talking even in the cart as they drove along he talked and talked. probably the other heard nothing he would begin to listen now and then and at the third word or so he had forgotten all about it. at last he began to mount the steps his legs were tied so that he had to take very small steps. the priest who seemed to be a wise man had stopped talking now and only held the cross for the wretched fellow to kiss. at the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough but when he set foot on the scaffold at the top his face suddenly became the colour of paper positively like white notepaper. his legs must have become suddenly feeble and helpless and he felt a choking in his throat you know the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear when one does not lose one s wits but is absolutely powerless to move if some dreadful thing were suddenly to happen if a house were just about to fall on one don t you know how one would long to sit down and shut one s eyes and wait and wait well when this terrible feeling came over him the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips without a word a little silver cross it was and he kept on pressing it to the man s lips every second. and whenever the cross touched his lips the eyes would open for a moment and the legs moved once and he kissed the cross greedily hurriedly just as though he were anxious to catch hold of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards though he could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the time. and so up to the very block. how strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment on the contrary the brain is especially active and works incessantly probably hard hard hard like an engine at full pressure. i imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his head all unfinished ones and strange funny thoughts very likely like this for instance that man is looking at me and he has a wart on his forehead and the executioner has burst one of his buttons and the lowest one is all rusty and meanwhile he notices and remembers everything. there is one point that cannot be forgotten round which everything else dances and turns about and because of this point he cannot faint and this lasts until the very final quarter of a second when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens and waits and knows that s the point he knows that he is just now about to die and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head. if i lay there i should certainly listen for that grating sound and hear it too there would probably be but the tenth part of an instant left to hear it in but one would certainly hear it. and imagine some people declare that when the head flies off it is conscious of having flown off just imagine what a thing to realize fancy if consciousness were to last for even five seconds draw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in clearly. the criminal must be just stepping on to it his face as white as note paper. the priest is holding the cross to his blue lips and the criminal kisses it and knows and sees and understands everything. the cross and the head there s your picture the priest and the executioner with his two assistants and a few heads and eyes below. those might come in as subordinate accessories a sort of mist. there s a picture for you. the prince paused and looked around. certainly that isn t much like quietism murmured alexandra half to herself. now tell us about your love affairs said adelaida after a moment s pause. the prince gazed at her in amazement. you know adelaida continued you owe us a description of the basle picture but first i wish to hear how you fell in love. don t deny the fact for you did of course. besides you stop philosophizing when you are telling about anything. why are you ashamed of your stories the moment after you have told them asked aglaya suddenly. how silly you are said mrs. epanchin looking indignantly towards the last speaker. yes that wasn t a clever remark said alexandra. don t listen to her prince said mrs. epanchin she says that sort of thing out of mischief. don t think anything of their nonsense it means nothing. they love to chaff but they like you. i can see it in their faces i know their faces. i know their faces too said the prince with a peculiar stress on the words. how so asked adelaida with curiosity. what do you know about our faces exclaimed the other two in chorus. but the prince was silent and serious. all awaited his reply. i ll tell you afterwards he said quietly. ah you want to arouse our curiosity said aglaya. and how terribly solemn you are about it very well interrupted adelaida then if you can read faces so well you must have been in love. come now i ve guessed let s have the secret i have not been in love said the prince as quietly and seriously as before. i have been happy in another way. how how well i ll tell you said the prince apparently in a deep reverie. vi. here you all are began the prince settling yourselves down to listen to me with so much curiosity that if i do not satisfy you you will probably be angry with me. no no i m only joking he added hastily with a smile. well then they were all children there and i was always among children and only with children. they were the children of the village in which i lived and they went to the school there all of them. i did not teach them oh no there was a master for that one jules thibaut. i may have taught them some things but i was among them just as an outsider and i passed all four years of my life there among them. i wished for nothing better i used to tell them everything and hid nothing from them. their fathers and relations were very angry with me because the children could do nothing without me at last and used to throng after me at all times. the schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in the end i had many enemies and all because of the children. even schneider reproached me. what were they afraid of one can tell a child everything anything. i have often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so little. they should not conceal so much from them. how well even little children understand that their parents conceal things from them because they consider them too young to understand children are capable of giving advice in the most important matters. how can one deceive these dear little birds when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly i call them birds because there is nothing in the world better than birds however most of the people were angry with me about one and the same thing but thibaut simply was jealous of me. at first he had wagged his head and wondered how it was that the children understood what i told them so well and could not learn from him and he laughed like anything when i replied that neither he nor i could teach them very much but that they might teach us a good deal. how he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me living among children as he did is what i cannot understand. children soothe and heal the wounded heart. i remember there was one poor fellow at our professor s who was being treated for madness and you have no idea what those children did for him eventually. i don t think he was mad but only terribly unhappy. but i ll tell you all about him another day. now i must get on with this story. the children did not love me at first i was such a sickly awkward kind of a fellow then and i know i am ugly. besides i was a foreigner. the children used to laugh at me at first and they even went so far as to throw stones at me when they saw me kiss marie. i only kissed her once in my life no no don t laugh the prince hastened to suppress the smiles of his audience at this point. it was not a matter of love at all if only you knew what a miserable creature she was you would have pitied her just as i did. she belonged to our village. her mother was an old old woman and they used to sell string and thread and soap and tobacco out of the window of their little house and lived on the pittance they gained by this trade. the old woman was ill and very old and could hardly move. marie was her daughter a girl of twenty weak and thin and consumptive but still she did heavy work at the houses around day by day. well one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed her and carried her off and a week later he deserted her. she came home dirty draggled and shoeless she had walked for a whole week without shoes she had slept in the fields and caught a terrible cold her feet were swollen and sore and her hands torn and scratched all over. she never had been pretty even before but her eyes were quiet innocent kind eyes. she was very quiet always and i remember once when she had suddenly begun singing at her work everyone said marie tried to sing today and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after. she had been treated kindly in the place before but when she came back now ill and shunned and miserable not one of them all had the slightest sympathy for her. cruel people oh what hazy understandings they have on such matters her mother was the first to show the way. she received her wrathfully unkindly and with contempt. you have disgraced me she said. she was the first to cast her into ignominy but when they all heard that marie had returned to the village they ran out to see her and crowded into the little cottage old men children women girls such a hurrying stamping greedy crowd. marie was lying on the floor at the old woman s feet hungry torn draggled crying miserable. when everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her dishevelled hair and lay cowering on the floor. everyone looked at her as though she were a piece of dirt off the road. the old men scolded and condemned and the young ones laughed at her. the women condemned her too and looked at her contemptuously just as though she were some loathsome insect. her mother allowed all this to go on and nodded her head and encouraged them. the old woman was very ill at that time and knew she was dying she really did die a couple of months later and though she felt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter to the very day of her death. she would not even speak to her. she made her sleep on straw in a shed and hardly gave her food enough to support life. marie was very gentle to her mother and nursed her and did everything for her but the old woman accepted all her services without a word and never showed her the slightest kindness. marie bore all this and i could see when i got to know her that she thought it quite right and fitting considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures. when the old woman took to her bed finally the other old women in the village sat with her by turns as the custom is there and then marie was quite driven out of the house. they gave her no food at all and she could not get any work in the village none would employ her. the men seemed to consider her no longer a woman they said such dreadful things to her. sometimes on sundays if they were drunk enough they used to throw her a penny or two into the mud and marie would silently pick up the money. she had began to spit blood at that time. at last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of appearing in the village any longer. the children used to pelt her with mud so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd but the cowherd would not have her. then she took to helping him without leave and he saw how valuable her assistance was to him and did not drive her away again on the contrary he occasionally gave her the remnants of his dinner bread and cheese. he considered that he was being very kind. when the mother died the village parson was not ashamed to hold marie up to public derision and shame. marie was standing at the coffin s head in all her rags crying. a crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry. the parson a young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher began his sermon and pointed to marie. there he said there is the cause of the death of this venerable woman which was a lie because she had been ill for at least two years there she stands before you and dares not lift her eyes from the ground because she knows that the finger of god is upon her. look at her tatters and rags the badge of those who lose their virtue. who is she her daughter and so on to the end. and just fancy this infamy pleased them all of them nearly. only the children had altered for then they were all on my side and had learned to love marie. this is how it was i had wished to do something for marie i longed to give her some money but i never had a farthing while i was there. but i had a little diamond pin and this i sold to a travelling pedlar he gave me eight francs for it it was worth at least forty. i long sought to meet marie alone and at last i did meet her on the hillside beyond the village. i gave her the eight francs and asked her to take care of the money because i could get no more and then i kissed her and said that she was not to suppose i kissed her with any evil motives or because i was in love with her for that i did so solely out of pity for her and because from the first i had not accounted her as guilty so much as unfortunate. i longed to console and encourage her somehow and to assure her that she was not the low base thing which she and others strove to make out but i don t think she understood me. she stood before me dreadfully ashamed of herself and with downcast eyes and when i had finished she kissed my hand. i would have kissed hers but she drew it away. just at this moment the whole troop of children saw us. i found out afterwards that they had long kept a watch upon me. they all began whistling and clapping their hands and laughing at us. marie ran away at once and when i tried to talk to them they threw stones at me. all the village heard of it the same day and marie s position became worse than ever. the children would not let her pass now in the streets but annoyed her and threw dirt at her more than before. they used to run after her she racing away with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping and they pelting her and shouting abuse at her. once i had to interfere by force and after that i took to speaking to them every day and whenever i could. occasionally they stopped and listened but they teased marie all the same. i told them how unhappy marie was and after a while they stopped their abuse of her and let her go by silently. little by little we got into the way of conversing together the children and i. i concealed nothing from them i told them all. they listened very attentively and soon began to be sorry for marie. at last some of them took to saying good morning to her kindly when they met her. it is the custom there to salute anyone you meet with good morning whether acquainted or not. i can imagine how astonished marie was at these first greetings from the children. once two little girls got hold of some food and took it to her and came back and told me. they said she had burst into tears and that they loved her very much now. very soon after that they all became fond of marie and at the same time they began to develop the greatest affection for myself. they often came to me and begged me to tell them stories. i think i must have told stories well for they did so love to hear them. at last i took to reading up interesting things on purpose to pass them on to the little ones and this went on for all the rest of my time there three years. later when everyone even schneider was angry with me for hiding nothing from the children i pointed out how foolish it was for they always knew things only they learnt them in a way that soiled their minds but not so from me. one has only to remember one s own childhood to admit the truth of this. but nobody was convinced... it was two weeks before her mother died that i had kissed marie and when the clergyman preached that sermon the children were all on my side. when i told them what a shame it was of the parson to talk as he had done and explained my reason they were so angry that some of them went and broke his windows with stones. of course i stopped them for that was not right but all the village heard of it and how i caught it for spoiling the children everyone discovered now that the little ones had taken to being fond of marie and their parents were terribly alarmed but marie was so happy. the children were forbidden to meet her but they used to run out of the village to the herd and take her food and things and sometimes just ran off there and kissed her and said je vous aime marie and then trotted back again. they imagined that i was in love with marie and this was the only point on which i did not undeceive them for they got such enjoyment out of it. and what delicacy and tenderness they showed in the evening i used to walk to the waterfall. there was a spot there which was quite closed in and hidden from view by large trees and to this spot the children used to come to me. they could not bear that their dear leon should love a poor girl without shoes to her feet and dressed all in rags and tatters. so would you believe it they actually clubbed together somehow and bought her shoes and stockings and some linen and even a dress i can t understand how they managed it but they did it all together. when i asked them about it they only laughed and shouted and the little girls clapped their hands and kissed me. i sometimes went to see marie secretly too. she had become very ill and could hardly walk. she still went with the herd but could not help the herdsman any longer. she used to sit on a stone near and wait there almost motionless all day till the herd went home. her consumption was so advanced and she was so weak that she used to sit with closed eyes breathing heavily. her face was as thin as a skeleton s and sweat used to stand on her white brow in large drops. i always found her sitting just like that. i used to come up quietly to look at her but marie would hear me open her eyes and tremble violently as she kissed my hands. i did not take my hand away because it made her happy to have it and so she would sit and cry quietly. sometimes she tried to speak but it was very difficult to understand her. she was almost like a madwoman with excitement and ecstasy whenever i came. occasionally the children came with me when they did so they would stand some way off and keep guard over us so as to tell me if anybody came near. this was a great pleasure to them. when we left her marie used to relapse at once into her old condition and sit with closed eyes and motionless limbs. one day she could not go out at all and remained at home all alone in the empty hut but the children very soon became aware of the fact and nearly all of them visited her that day as she lay alone and helpless in her miserable bed. for two days the children looked after her and then when the village people got to know that marie was really dying some of the old women came and took it in turns to sit by her and look after her a bit. i think they began to be a little sorry for her in the village at last at all events they did not interfere with the children any more on her account. marie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole while she coughed dreadfully. the old women would not let the children stay in the room but they all collected outside the window each morning if only for a moment and shouted bon jour notre bonne marie and marie no sooner caught sight of or heard them and she became quite animated at once and in spite of the old women would try to sit up and nod her head and smile at them and thank them. the little ones used to bring her nice things and sweets to eat but she could hardly touch anything. thanks to them i assure you the girl died almost perfectly happy. she almost forgot her misery and seemed to accept their love as a sort of symbol of pardon for her offence though she never ceased to consider herself a dreadful sinner. they used to flutter at her window just like little birds calling out nous t aimons marie she died very soon i had thought she would live much longer. the day before her death i went to see her for the last time just before sunset. i think she recognized me for she pressed my hand. next morning they came and told me that marie was dead. the children could not be restrained now they went and covered her coffin with flowers and put a wreath of lovely blossoms on her head. the pastor did not throw any more shameful words at the poor dead woman but there were very few people at the funeral. however when it came to carrying the coffin all the children rushed up to carry it themselves. of course they could not do it alone but they insisted on helping and walked alongside and behind crying. they have planted roses all round her grave and every year they look after the flowers and make marie s resting place as beautiful as they can. i was in ill odour after all this with the parents of the children and especially with the parson and schoolmaster. schneider was obliged to promise that i should not meet them and talk to them but we conversed from a distance by signs and they used to write me sweet little notes. afterwards i came closer than ever to those little souls but even then it was very dear to me to have them so fond of me. schneider said that i did the children great harm by my pernicious system what nonsense that was and what did he mean by my system he said afterwards that he believed i was a child myself just before i came away. you have the form and face of an adult he said but as regards soul and character and perhaps even intelligence you are a child in the completest sense of the word and always will be if you live to be sixty. i laughed very much for of course that is nonsense. but it is a fact that i do not care to be among grown up people and much prefer the society of children. however kind people may be to me i never feel quite at home with them and am always glad to get back to my little companions. now my companions have always been children not because i was a child myself once but because young things attract me. on one of the first days of my stay in switzerland i was strolling about alone and miserable when i came upon the children rushing noisily out of school with their slates and bags and books their games their laughter and shouts and my soul went out to them. i stopped and laughed happily as i watched their little feet moving so quickly. girls and boys laughing and crying for as they went home many of them found time to fight and make peace to weep and play. i forgot my troubles in looking at them. and then all those three years i tried to understand why men should be for ever tormenting themselves. i lived the life of a child there and thought i should never leave the little village indeed i was far from thinking that i should ever return to russia. but at last i recognized the fact that schneider could not keep me any longer. and then something so important happened that schneider himself urged me to depart. i am going to see now if can get good advice about it. perhaps my lot in life will be changed but that is not the principal thing. the principal thing is the entire change that has already come over me. i left many things behind me too many. they have gone. on the journey i said to myself i am going into the world of men. i don t know much perhaps but a new life has begun for me. i made up my mind to be honest and steadfast in accomplishing my task. perhaps i shall meet with troubles and many disappointments but i have made up my mind to be polite and sincere to everyone more cannot be asked of me. people may consider me a child if they like. i am often called an idiot and at one time i certainly was so ill that i was nearly as bad as an idiot but i am not an idiot now. how can i possibly be so when i know myself that i am considered one when i received a letter from those dear little souls while passing through berlin i only then realized how much i loved them. it was very very painful getting that first little letter. how melancholy they had been when they saw me off for a month before they had been talking of my departure and sorrowing over it and at the waterfall of an evening when we parted for the night they would hug me so tight and kiss me so warmly far more so than before. and every now and then they would turn up one by one when i was alone just to give me a kiss and a hug to show their love for me. the whole flock went with me to the station which was about a mile from the village and every now and then one of them would stop to throw his arms round me and all the little girls had tears in their voices though they tried hard not to cry. as the train steamed out of the station i saw them all standing on the platform waving to me and crying hurrah till they were lost in the distance. i assure you when i came in here just now and saw your kind faces i can read faces well my heart felt light for the first time since that moment of parting. i think i must be one of those who are born to be in luck for one does not often meet with people whom one feels he can love from the first sight of their faces and yet no sooner do i step out of the railway carriage than i happen upon you i know it is more or less a shamefaced thing to speak of one s feelings before others and yet here am i talking like this to you and am not a bit ashamed or shy. i am an unsociable sort of fellow and shall very likely not come to see you again for some time but don t think the worse of me for that. it is not that i do not value your society and you must never suppose that i have taken offence at anything. you asked me about your faces and what i could read in them i will tell you with the greatest pleasure. you adelaida ivanovna have a very happy face it is the most sympathetic of the three. not to speak of your natural beauty one can look at your face and say to one s self she has the face of a kind sister. you are simple and merry but you can see into another s heart very quickly. that s what i read in your face. you too alexandra ivanovna have a very lovely face but i think you may have some secret sorrow. your heart is undoubtedly a kind good one but you are not merry. there is a certain suspicion of shadow in your face like in that of holbein s madonna in dresden. so much for your face. have i guessed right as for your face lizabetha prokofievna i not only think but am perfectly sure that you are an absolute child in all in all mind both good and bad and in spite of your years. don t be angry with me for saying so you know what my feelings for children are. and do not suppose that i am so candid out of pure simplicity of soul. oh dear no it is by no means the case perhaps i have my own very profound object in view. vii. when the prince ceased speaking all were gazing merrily at him even aglaya but lizabetha prokofievna looked the jolliest of all. well she cried we have put him through his paces with a vengeance my dears you imagined i believe that you were about to patronize this young gentleman like some poor prot g picked up somewhere and taken under your magnificent protection. what fools we were and what a specially big fool is your father well done prince i assure you the general actually asked me to put you through your paces and examine you. as to what you said about my face you are absolutely correct in your judgment. i am a child and know it. i knew it long before you said so you have expressed my own thoughts. i think your nature and mine must be extremely alike and i am very glad of it. we are like two drops of water only you are a man and i a woman and i ve not been to switzerland and that is all the difference between us. don t be in a hurry mother the prince says that he has some motive behind his simplicity cried aglaya. yes yes so he does laughed the others. oh don t you begin bantering him said mamma. he is probably a good deal cleverer than all three of you girls put together. we shall see. only you haven t told us anything about aglaya yet prince and aglaya and i are both waiting to hear. i cannot say anything at present. i ll tell you afterwards. why her face is clear enough isn t it oh yes of course. you are very beautiful aglaya ivanovna so beautiful that one is afraid to look at you. is that all what about her character persisted mrs. epanchin. it is difficult to judge when such beauty is concerned. i have not prepared my judgment. beauty is a riddle. that means that you have set aglaya a riddle said adelaida. guess it aglaya but she s pretty prince isn t she most wonderfully so said the latter warmly gazing at aglaya with admiration. almost as lovely as nastasia philipovna but quite a different type. all present exchanged looks of surprise. as lovely as who said mrs. epanchin. as nastasia philipovna where have you seen nastasia philipovna what nastasia philipovna gavrila ardalionovitch showed the general her portrait just now. how so did he bring the portrait for my husband only to show it. nastasia philipovna gave it to gavrila ardalionovitch today and the latter brought it here to show to the general. i must see it cried mrs. epanchin. where is the portrait if she gave it to him he must have it and he is still in the study. he never leaves before four o clock on wednesdays. send for gavrila ardalionovitch at once. no i don t long to see him so much. look here dear prince be so kind will you just step to the study and fetch this portrait say we want to look at it. please do this for me will you he is a nice fellow but a little too simple said adelaida as the prince left the room. he is indeed said alexandra almost laughably so at times. neither one nor the other seemed to give expression to her full thoughts. he got out of it very neatly about our faces though said aglaya. he flattered us all round even mamma. nonsense cried the latter. he did not flatter me. it was i who found his appreciation flattering. i think you are a great deal more foolish than he is. he is simple of course but also very knowing. just like myself. how stupid of me to speak of the portrait thought the prince as he entered the study with a feeling of guilt at his heart and yet perhaps i was right after all. he had an idea unformed as yet but a strange idea. gavrila ardalionovitch was still sitting in the study buried in a mass of papers. he looked as though he did not take his salary from the public company whose servant he was for a sinecure. he grew very wroth and confused when the prince asked for the portrait and explained how it came about that he had spoken of it. oh curse it all he said what on earth must you go blabbing for you know nothing about the thing and yet idiot he added muttering the last word to himself in irrepressible rage. i am very sorry i was not thinking at the time. i merely said that aglaya was almost as beautiful as nastasia philipovna. gania asked for further details and the prince once more repeated the conversation. gania looked at him with ironical contempt the while. nastasia philipovna he began and there paused he was clearly much agitated and annoyed. the prince reminded him of the portrait. listen prince said gania as though an idea had just struck him i wish to ask you a great favour and yet i really don t know he paused again he was trying to make up his mind to something and was turning the matter over. the prince waited quietly. once more gania fixed him with intent and questioning eyes. prince he began again they are rather angry with me in there owing to a circumstance which i need not explain so that i do not care to go in at present without an invitation. i particularly wish to speak to aglaya but i have written a few words in case i shall not have the chance of seeing her here the prince observed a small note in his hand and i do not know how to get my communication to her. don t you think you could undertake to give it to her at once but only to her mind and so that no one else should see you give it it isn t much of a secret but still well will you do it i don t quite like it replied the prince. oh but it is absolutely necessary for me gania entreated. believe me if it were not so i would not ask you how else am i to get it to her it is most important dreadfully important gania was evidently much alarmed at the idea that the prince would not consent to take his note and he looked at him now with an expression of absolute entreaty. well i will take it then. but mind nobody is to see cried the delighted gania and of course i may rely on your word of honour eh i won t show it to anyone said the prince. the letter is not sealed continued gania and paused in confusion. oh i won t read it said the prince quite simply. he took up the portrait and went out of the room. gania left alone clutched his head with his hands. one word from her he said one word from her and i may yet be free. he could not settle himself to his papers again for agitation and excitement but began walking up and down the room from corner to corner. the prince walked along musing. he did not like his commission and disliked the idea of gania sending a note to aglaya at all but when he was two rooms distant from the drawing room where they all were he stopped as though recalling something went to the window nearer the light and began to examine the portrait in his hand. he longed to solve the mystery of something in the face of nastasia philipovna something which had struck him as he looked at the portrait for the first time the impression had not left him. it was partly the fact of her marvellous beauty that struck him and partly something else. there was a suggestion of immense pride and disdain in the face almost of hatred and at the same time something confiding and very full of simplicity. the contrast aroused a deep sympathy in his heart as he looked at the lovely face. the blinding loveliness of it was almost intolerable this pale thin face with its flaming eyes it was a strange beauty. the prince gazed at it for a minute or two then glanced around him and hurriedly raised the portrait to his lips. when a minute after he reached the drawing room door his face was quite composed. but just as he reached the door he met aglaya coming out alone. gavrila ardalionovitch begged me to give you this he said handing her the note. aglaya stopped took the letter and gazed strangely into the prince s eyes. there was no confusion in her face a little surprise perhaps but that was all. by her look she seemed merely to challenge the prince to an explanation as to how he and gania happened to be connected in this matter. but her expression was perfectly cool and quiet and even condescending. so they stood for a moment or two confronting one another. at length a faint smile passed over her face and she passed by him without a word. mrs. epanchin examined the portrait of nastasia philipovna for some little while holding it critically at arm s length. yes she is pretty she said at last even very pretty. i have seen her twice but only at a distance. so you admire this kind of beauty do you she asked the prince suddenly. yes i do this kind. do you mean especially this kind yes especially this kind. why there is much suffering in this face murmured the prince more as though talking to himself than answering the question. i think you are wandering a little prince mrs. epanchin decided after a lengthened survey of his face and she tossed the portrait on to the table haughtily. alexandra took it and adelaida came up and both the girls examined the photograph. just then aglaya entered the room. what a power cried adelaida suddenly as she earnestly examined the portrait over her sister s shoulder. whom what power asked her mother crossly. such beauty is real power said adelaida. with such beauty as that one might overthrow the world. she returned to her easel thoughtfully. aglaya merely glanced at the portrait frowned and put out her underlip then went and sat down on the sofa with folded hands. mrs. epanchin rang the bell. ask gavrila ardalionovitch to step this way said she to the man who answered. mamma cried alexandra significantly. i shall just say two words to him that s all said her mother silencing all objection by her manner she was evidently seriously put out. you see prince it is all secrets with us just now all secrets. it seems to be the etiquette of the house for some reason or other. stupid nonsense and in a matter which ought to be approached with all candour and open heartedness. there is a marriage being talked of and i don t like this marriage mamma what are you saying said alexandra again hurriedly. well what my dear girl as if you can possibly like it yourself the heart is the great thing and the rest is all rubbish though one must have sense as well. perhaps sense is really the great thing. don t smile like that aglaya. i don t contradict myself. a fool with a heart and no brains is just as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart. i am one and you are the other and therefore both of us suffer both of us are unhappy. why are you so unhappy mother asked adelaida who alone of all the company seemed to have preserved her good temper and spirits up to now. in the first place because of my carefully brought up daughters said mrs. epanchin cuttingly and as that is the best reason i can give you we need not bother about any other at present. enough of words now we shall see how both of you i don t count aglaya will manage your business and whether you most revered alexandra ivanovna will be happy with your fine mate. ah she added as gania suddenly entered the room here s another marrying subject. how do you do she continued in response to gania s bow but she did not invite him to sit down. you are going to be married married how what marriage murmured gania overwhelmed with confusion. are you about to take a wife i ask if you prefer that expression. no no i i no said gania bringing out his lie with a tell tale blush of shame. he glanced keenly at aglaya who was sitting some way off and dropped his eyes immediately. aglaya gazed coldly intently and composedly at him without taking her eyes off his face and watched his confusion. no you say no do you continued the pitiless mrs. general. very well i shall remember that you told me this wednesday morning in answer to my question that you are not going to be married. what day is it wednesday isn t it yes i think so said adelaida. you never know the day of the week what s the day of the month twenty seventh said gania. twenty seventh very well. good bye now you have a good deal to do i m sure and i must dress and go out. take your portrait. give my respects to your unfortunate mother nina alexandrovna. au revoir dear prince come in and see us often do and i shall tell old princess bielokonski about you. i shall go and see her on purpose. and listen my dear boy i feel sure that god has sent you to petersburg from switzerland on purpose for me. maybe you will have other things to do besides but you are sent chiefly for my sake i feel sure of it. god sent you to me au revoir alexandra come with me my dear. mrs. epanchin left the room. gania confused annoyed furious took up his portrait and turned to the prince with a nasty smile on his face. prince he said i am just going home. if you have not changed your mind as to living with us perhaps you would like to come with me. you don t know the address i believe wait a minute prince said aglaya suddenly rising from her seat do write something in my album first will you father says you are a most talented caligraphist i ll bring you my book in a minute. she left the room. well au revoir prince said adelaida i must be going too. she pressed the prince s hand warmly and gave him a friendly smile as she left the room. she did not so much as look at gania. this is your doing prince said gania turning on the latter so soon as the others were all out of the room. this is your doing sir you have been telling them that i am going to be married he said this in a hurried whisper his eyes flashing with rage and his face ablaze. you shameless tattler i assure you you are under a delusion said the prince calmly and politely. i did not even know that you were to be married. you heard me talking about it the general and me. you heard me say that everything was to be settled today at nastasia philipovna s and you went and blurted it out here. you lie if you deny it. who else could have told them devil take it sir who could have told them except yourself didn t the old woman as good as hint as much to me if she hinted to you who told her you must know best of course but i never said a word about it. did you give my note is there an answer interrupted gania impatiently. but at this moment aglaya came back and the prince had no time to reply. there prince said she there s my album. now choose a page and write me something will you there s a pen a new one do you mind a steel one i have heard that you caligraphists don t like steel pens. conversing with the prince aglaya did not even seem to notice that gania was in the room. but while the prince was getting his pen ready finding a page and making his preparations to write gania came up to the fireplace where aglaya was standing to the right of the prince and in trembling broken accents said almost in her ear one word just one word from you and i m saved. the prince turned sharply round and looked at both of them. gania s face was full of real despair he seemed to have said the words almost unconsciously and on the impulse of the moment. aglaya gazed at him for some seconds with precisely the same composure and calm astonishment as she had shown a little while before when the prince handed her the note and it appeared that this calm surprise and seemingly absolute incomprehension of what was said to her were more terribly overwhelming to gania than even the most plainly expressed disdain would have been. what shall i write asked the prince. i ll dictate to you said aglaya coming up to the table. now then are you ready write i never condescend to bargain now put your name and the date. let me see it. the prince handed her the album. capital how beautifully you have written it thanks so much. au revoir prince. wait a minute she added i want to give you something for a keepsake. come with me this way will you the prince followed her. arrived at the dining room she stopped. read this she said handing him gania s note. the prince took it from her hand but gazed at her in bewilderment. oh i know you haven t read it and that you could never be that man s accomplice. read it i wish you to read it. the letter had evidently been written in a hurry my fate is to be decided today it ran you know how. this day i must give my word irrevocably. i have no right to ask your help and i dare not allow myself to indulge in any hopes but once you said just one word and that word lighted up the night of my life and became the beacon of my days. say one more such word and save me from utter ruin. only tell me break off the whole thing and i will do so this very day. oh what can it cost you to say just this one word in doing so you will but be giving me a sign of your sympathy for me and of your pity only this only this nothing more nothing . i dare not indulge in any hope because i am unworthy of it. but if you say but this word i will take up my cross again with joy and return once more to my battle with poverty. i shall meet the storm and be glad of it i shall rise up with renewed strength. send me back then this one word of sympathy only sympathy i swear to you and oh do not be angry with the audacity of despair with the drowning man who has dared to make this last effort to save himself from perishing beneath the waters. g.l. this man assures me said aglaya scornfully when the prince had finished reading the letter that the words break off everything do not commit me to anything whatever and himself gives me a written guarantee to that effect in this letter. observe how ingenuously he underlines certain words and how crudely he glosses over his hidden thoughts. he must know that if he broke off everything first by himself and without telling me a word about it or having the slightest hope on my account that in that case i should perhaps be able to change my opinion of him and even accept his friendship. he must know that but his soul is such a wretched thing. he knows it and cannot make up his mind he knows it and yet asks for guarantees. he cannot bring himself to trust he wants me to give him hopes of myself before he lets go of his hundred thousand roubles. as to the former word which he declares lighted up the night of his life he is simply an impudent liar i merely pitied him once. but he is audacious and shameless. he immediately began to hope at that very moment. i saw it. he has tried to catch me ever since he is still fishing for me. well enough of this. take the letter and give it back to him as soon as you have left our house not before of course. and what shall i tell him by way of answer nothing of course that s the best answer. is it the case that you are going to live in his house yes your father kindly recommended me to him. then look out for him i warn you he won t forgive you easily for taking back the letter. aglaya pressed the prince s hand and left the room. her face was serious and frowning she did not even smile as she nodded good bye to him at the door. i ll just get my parcel and we ll go said the prince to gania as he re entered the drawing room. gania stamped his foot with impatience. his face looked dark and gloomy with rage. at last they left the house behind them the prince carrying his bundle. the answer quick the answer said gania the instant they were outside. what did she say did you give the letter the prince silently held out the note. gania was struck motionless with amazement. how what my letter he cried. he never delivered it i might have guessed it oh curse him of course she did not understand what i meant naturally why why why didn t you give her the note you excuse me i was able to deliver it almost immediately after receiving your commission and i gave it too just as you asked me to. it has come into my hands now because aglaya ivanovna has just returned it to me. how when as soon as i finished writing in her album for her and when she asked me to come out of the room with her you heard we went into the dining room and she gave me your letter to read and then told me to return it. to read cried gania almost at the top of his voice to read and you read it and again he stood like a log in the middle of the pavement so amazed that his mouth remained open after the last word had left it. yes i have just read it. and she gave it you to read herself herself yes herself and you may believe me when i tell you that i would not have read it for anything without her permission. gania was silent for a minute or two as though thinking out some problem. suddenly he cried it s impossible she cannot have given it to you to read you are lying. you read it yourself i am telling you the truth said the prince in his former composed tone of voice and believe me i am extremely sorry that the circumstance should have made such an unpleasant impression upon you but you wretched man at least she must have said something there must be some answer from her yes of course she did say something out with it then damn it out with it at once and gania stamped his foot twice on the pavement. as soon as i had finished reading it she told me that you were fishing for her that you wished to compromise her so far as to receive some hopes from her trusting to which hopes you might break with the prospect of receiving a hundred thousand roubles. she said that if you had done this without bargaining with her if you had broken with the money prospects without trying to force a guarantee out of her first she might have been your friend. that s all i think. oh no when i asked her what i was to say as i took the letter she replied that no answer is the best answer. i think that was it. forgive me if i do not use her exact expressions. i tell you the sense as i understood it myself. ungovernable rage and madness took entire possession of gania and his fury burst out without the least attempt at restraint. oh that s it is it he yelled. she throws my letters out of the window does she oh and she does not condescend to bargain while i do eh we shall see we shall see i shall pay her out for this. he twisted himself about with rage and grew paler and paler he shook his fist. so the pair walked along a few steps. gania did not stand on ceremony with the prince he behaved just as though he were alone in his room. he clearly counted the latter as a nonentity. but suddenly he seemed to have an idea and recollected himself. but how was it he asked how was it that you idiot that you are he added to himself were so very confidential a couple of hours after your first meeting with these people how was that eh up to this moment jealousy had not been one of his torments now it suddenly gnawed at his heart. that is a thing i cannot undertake to explain replied the prince. gania looked at him with angry contempt. oh i suppose the present she wished to make to you when she took you into the dining room was her confidence eh i suppose that was it i cannot explain it otherwise. but why why devil take it what did you do in there why did they fancy you look here can t you remember exactly what you said to them from the very beginning can t you remember oh we talked of a great many things. when first i went in we began to speak of switzerland. oh the devil take switzerland then about executions. executions yes at least about one. then i told the whole three years story of my life and the history of a poor peasant girl oh damn the peasant girl go on go on said gania impatiently. then how schneider told me about my childish nature and oh curse schneider and his dirty opinions go on. then i began to talk about faces at least about the expressions of faces and said that aglaya ivanovna was nearly as lovely as nastasia philipovna. it was then i blurted out about the portrait but you didn t repeat what you heard in the study you didn t repeat that eh no i tell you i did not . then how did they look here did aglaya show my letter to the old lady oh there i can give you my fullest assurance that she did not . i was there all the while she had no time to do it but perhaps you may not have observed it oh you damned idiot you he shouted quite beside himself with fury. you can t even describe what went on. gania having once descended to abuse and receiving no check very soon knew no bounds or limit to his licence as is often the way in such cases. his rage so blinded him that he had not even been able to detect that this idiot whom he was abusing to such an extent was very far from being slow of comprehension and had a way of taking in an impression and afterwards giving it out again which was very un idiotic indeed. but something a little unforeseen now occurred. i think i ought to tell you gavrila ardalionovitch said the prince suddenly that though i once was so ill that i really was little better than an idiot yet now i am almost recovered and that therefore it is not altogether pleasant to be called an idiot to my face. of course your anger is excusable considering the treatment you have just experienced but i must remind you that you have twice abused me rather rudely. i do not like this sort of thing and especially so at the first time of meeting a man and therefore as we happen to be at this moment standing at a crossroad don t you think we had better part you to the left homewards and i to the right here i have twenty five roubles and i shall easily find a lodging. gania was much confused and blushed for shame do forgive me prince he cried suddenly changing his abusive tone for one of great courtesy. for heaven s sake forgive me you see what a miserable plight i am in but you hardly know anything of the facts of the case as yet. if you did i am sure you would forgive me at least partially. of course it was inexcusable of me i know but oh dear me i really do not require such profuse apologies replied the prince hastily. i quite understand how unpleasant your position is and that is what made you abuse me. so come along to your house after all. i shall be delighted i am not going to let him go like this thought gania glancing angrily at the prince as they walked along. the fellow has sucked everything out of me and now he takes off his mask there s something more than appears here we shall see. it shall all be as clear as water by tonight everything but by this time they had reached gania s house. viii. the flat occupied by gania and his family was on the third floor of the house. it was reached by a clean light staircase and consisted of seven rooms a nice enough lodging and one would have thought a little too good for a clerk on two thousand roubles a year. but it was designed to accommodate a few lodgers on board terms and had been taken a few months since much to the disgust of gania at the urgent request of his mother and his sister varvara ardalionovna who longed to do something to increase the family income a little and fixed their hopes upon letting lodgings. gania frowned upon the idea. he thought it infra dig and did not quite like appearing in society afterwards that society in which he had been accustomed to pose up to now as a young man of rather brilliant prospects. all these concessions and rebuffs of fortune of late had wounded his spirit severely and his temper had become extremely irritable his wrath being generally quite out of proportion to the cause. but if he had made up his mind to put up with this sort of life for a while it was only on the plain understanding with his inner self that he would very soon change it all and have things as he chose again. yet the very means by which he hoped to make this change threatened to involve him in even greater difficulties than he had had before. the flat was divided by a passage which led straight out of the entrance hall. along one side of this corridor lay the three rooms which were designed for the accommodation of the highly recommended lodgers. besides these three rooms there was another small one at the end of the passage close to the kitchen which was allotted to general ivolgin the nominal master of the house who slept on a wide sofa and was obliged to pass into and out of his room through the kitchen and up or down the back stairs. colia gania s young brother a school boy of thirteen shared this room with his father. he too had to sleep on an old sofa a narrow uncomfortable thing with a torn rug over it his chief duty being to look after his father who needed to be watched more and more every day. the prince was given the middle room of the three the first being occupied by one ferdishenko while the third was empty. but gania first conducted the prince to the family apartments. these consisted of a salon which became the dining room when required a drawing room which was only a drawing room in the morning and became gania s study in the evening and his bedroom at night and lastly nina alexandrovna s and varvara s bedroom a small close chamber which they shared together. in a word the whole place was confined and a tight fit for the party. gania used to grind his teeth with rage over the state of affairs though he was anxious to be dutiful and polite to his mother. however it was very soon apparent to anyone coming into the house that gania was the tyrant of the family. nina alexandrovna and her daughter were both seated in the drawing room engaged in knitting and talking to a visitor ivan petrovitch ptitsin. the lady of the house appeared to be a woman of about fifty years of age thin faced and with black lines under the eyes. she looked ill and rather sad but her face was a pleasant one for all that and from the first word that fell from her lips any stranger would at once conclude that she was of a serious and particularly sincere nature. in spite of her sorrowful expression she gave the idea of possessing considerable firmness and decision. her dress was modest and simple to a degree dark and elderly in style but both her face and appearance gave evidence that she had seen better days. varvara was a girl of some twenty three summers of middle height thin but possessing a face which without being actually beautiful had the rare quality of charm and might fascinate even to the extent of passionate regard. she was very like her mother she even dressed like her which proved that she had no taste for smart clothes. the expression of her grey eyes was merry and gentle when it was not as lately too full of thought and anxiety. the same decision and firmness was to be observed in her face as in her mother s but her strength seemed to be more vigorous than that of nina alexandrovna. she was subject to outbursts of temper of which even her brother was a little afraid. the present visitor ptitsin was also afraid of her. this was a young fellow of something under thirty dressed plainly but neatly. his manners were good but rather ponderously so. his dark beard bore evidence to the fact that he was not in any government employ. he could speak well but preferred silence. on the whole he made a decidedly agreeable impression. he was clearly attracted by varvara and made no secret of his feelings. she trusted him in a friendly way but had not shown him any decided encouragement as yet which fact did not quell his ardour in the least. nina alexandrovna was very fond of him and had grown quite confidential with him of late. ptitsin as was well known was engaged in the business of lending out money on good security and at a good rate of interest. he was a great friend of gania s. after a formal introduction by gania who greeted his mother very shortly took no notice of his sister and immediately marched ptitsin out of the room nina alexandrovna addressed a few kind words to the prince and forthwith requested colia who had just appeared at the door to show him to the middle room. colia was a nice looking boy. his expression was simple and confiding and his manners were very polite and engaging. where s your luggage he asked as he led the prince away to his room. i had a bundle it s in the entrance hall. i ll bring it you directly. we only have a cook and one maid so i have to help as much as i can. varia looks after things generally and loses her temper over it. gania says you have only just arrived from switzerland yes. is it jolly there very. mountains yes. i ll go and get your bundle. here varvara joined them. the maid shall bring your bed linen directly. have you a portmanteau no a bundle your brother has just gone to the hall for it. there s nothing there except this said colia returning at this moment. where did you put it oh but that s all i have said the prince taking it. ah i thought perhaps ferdishenko had taken it. don t talk nonsense said varia severely. she seemed put out and was only just polite with the prince. oho laughed the boy you can be nicer than that to me you know i m not ptitsin you ought to be whipped colia you silly boy. if you want anything to the prince please apply to the servant. we dine at half past four. you can take your dinner with us or have it in your room just as you please. come along colia don t disturb the prince. at the door they met gania coming in. is father in he asked. colia whispered something in his ear and went out. just a couple of words prince if you ll excuse me. don t blab over there about what you may see here or in this house as to all that about aglaya and me you know. things are not altogether pleasant in this establishment devil take it all you ll see. at all events keep your tongue to yourself for today . i assure you i blabbed a great deal less than you seem to suppose said the prince with some annoyance. clearly the relations between gania and himself were by no means improving. oh well i caught it quite hot enough today thanks to you. however i forgive you. i think you might fairly remember that i was not in any way bound i had no reason to be silent about that portrait. you never asked me not to mention it. pfu what a wretched room this is dark and the window looking into the yard. your coming to our house is in no respect opportune. however it s not my affair. i don t keep the lodgings. ptitsin here looked in and beckoned to gania who hastily left the room in spite of the fact that he had evidently wished to say something more and had only made the remark about the room to gain time. the prince had hardly had time to wash and tidy himself a little when the door opened once more and another figure appeared. this was a gentleman of about thirty tall broad shouldered and red haired his face was red too and he possessed a pair of thick lips a wide nose small eyes rather bloodshot and with an ironical expression in them as though he were perpetually winking at someone. his whole appearance gave one the idea of impudence his dress was shabby. he opened the door just enough to let his head in. his head remained so placed for a few seconds while he quietly scrutinized the room the door then opened enough to admit his body but still he did not enter. he stood on the threshold and examined the prince carefully. at last he gave the door a final shove entered approached the prince took his hand and seated himself and the owner of the room on two chairs side by side. ferdishenko he said gazing intently and inquiringly into the prince s eyes. very well what next said the latter almost laughing in his face. a lodger here continued the other staring as before. do you wish to make acquaintance asked the prince. ah said the visitor passing his fingers through his hair and sighing. he then looked over to the other side of the room and around it. got any money he asked suddenly. not much. how much twenty five roubles. let s see it. the prince took his banknote out and showed it to ferdishenko. the latter unfolded it and looked at it then he turned it round and examined the other side then he held it up to the light. how strange that it should have browned so he said reflectively. these twenty five rouble notes brown in a most extraordinary way while other notes often grow paler. take it. the prince took his note. ferdishenko rose. i came here to warn you he said. in the first place don t lend me any money for i shall certainly ask you to. very well. shall you pay here yes i intend to. oh i don t intend to. thanks. i live here next door to you you noticed a room did you don t come to me very often i shall see you here quite often enough. have you seen the general no. nor heard him no of course not. well you ll both hear and see him soon he even tries to borrow money from me. avis au lecteur. good bye do you think a man can possibly live with a name like ferdishenko why not good bye. and so he departed. the prince found out afterwards that this gentleman made it his business to amaze people with his originality and wit but that it did not as a rule come off. he even produced a bad impression on some people which grieved him sorely but he did not change his ways for all that. as he went out of the prince s room he collided with yet another visitor coming in. ferdishenko took the opportunity of making several warning gestures to the prince from behind the new arrival s back and left the room in conscious pride. this next arrival was a tall red faced man of about fifty five with greyish hair and whiskers and large eyes which stood out of their sockets. his appearance would have been distinguished had it not been that he gave the idea of being rather dirty. he was dressed in an old coat and he smelled of vodka when he came near. his walk was effective and he clearly did his best to appear dignified and to impress people by his manner. this gentleman now approached the prince slowly and with a most courteous smile silently took his hand and held it in his own as he examined the prince s features as though searching for familiar traits therein. tis he tis he he said at last quietly but with much solemnity. as though he were alive once more. i heard the familiar name the dear familiar name and oh how it reminded me of the irrevocable past prince muishkin i believe exactly so. general ivolgin retired and unfortunate. may i ask your christian and generic names lef nicolaievitch. so so the son of my old i may say my childhood s friend nicolai petrovitch. my father s name was nicolai lvovitch. lvovitch repeated the general without the slightest haste and with perfect confidence just as though he had not committed himself the least in the world but merely made a little slip of the tongue. he sat down and taking the prince s hand drew him to a seat next to himself. i carried you in my arms as a baby he observed. really asked the prince. why it s twenty years since my father died. yes yes twenty years and three months. we were educated together i went straight into the army and he my father went into the army too. he was a sub lieutenant in the vasiliefsky regiment. no sir in the bielomirsky he changed into the latter shortly before his death. i was at his bedside when he died and gave him my blessing for eternity. your mother the general paused as though overcome with emotion. she died a few months later from a cold said the prince. oh not cold believe an old man not from a cold but from grief for her prince. oh your mother your mother heigh ho youth youth your father and i old friends as we were nearly murdered each other for her sake. the prince began to be a little incredulous. i was passionately in love with her when she was engaged engaged to my friend. the prince noticed the fact and was furious. he came and woke me at seven o clock one morning. i rise and dress in amazement silence on both sides. i understand it all. he takes a couple of pistols out of his pocket across a handkerchief without witnesses. why invite witnesses when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of minutes the pistols are loaded we stretch the handkerchief and stand opposite one another. we aim the pistols at each other s hearts. suddenly tears start to our eyes our hands shake we weep we embrace the battle is one of self sacrifice now the prince shouts she is yours i cry she is yours in a word in a word you ve come to live with us hey yes yes for a while i think stammered the prince. prince mother begs you to come to her said colia appearing at the door. the prince rose to go but the general once more laid his hand in a friendly manner on his shoulder and dragged him down on to the sofa. as the true friend of your father i wish to say a few words to you he began. i have suffered there was a catastrophe. i suffered without a trial i had no trial. nina alexandrovna my wife is an excellent woman so is my daughter varvara. we have to let lodgings because we are poor a dreadful unheard of come down for us for me who should have been a governor general but we are very glad to have you at all events. meanwhile there is a tragedy in the house. the prince looked inquiringly at the other. yes a marriage is being arranged a marriage between a questionable woman and a young fellow who might be a flunkey. they wish to bring this woman into the house where my wife and daughter reside but while i live and breathe she shall never enter my doors. i shall lie at the threshold and she shall trample me underfoot if she does. i hardly talk to gania now and avoid him as much as i can. i warn you of this beforehand but you cannot fail to observe it. but you are the son of my old friend and i hope prince be so kind as to come to me for a moment in the drawing room said nina alexandrovna herself appearing at the door. imagine my dear cried the general it turns out that i have nursed the prince on my knee in the old days. his wife looked searchingly at him and glanced at the prince but said nothing. the prince rose and followed her but hardly had they reached the drawing room and nina alexandrovna had begun to talk hurriedly when in came the general. she immediately relapsed into silence. the master of the house may have observed this but at all events he did not take any notice of it he was in high good humour. a son of my old friend dear he cried surely you must remember prince nicolai lvovitch you saw him at at tver. i don t remember any nicolai lvovitch. was that your father she inquired of the prince. yes but he died at elizabethgrad not at tver said the prince rather timidly. so pavlicheff told me. no tver insisted the general he removed just before his death. you were very small and cannot remember and pavlicheff though an excellent fellow may have made a mistake. you knew pavlicheff then oh yes a wonderful fellow but i was present myself. i gave him my blessing. my father was just about to be tried when he died said the prince although i never knew of what he was accused. he died in hospital. oh it was the kolpakoff business and of course he would have been acquitted. yes do you know that for a fact asked the prince whose curiosity was aroused by the general s words. i should think so indeed cried the latter. the court martial came to no decision. it was a mysterious an impossible business one might say captain larionoff commander of the company had died his command was handed over to the prince for the moment. very well. this soldier kolpakoff stole some leather from one of his comrades intending to sell it and spent the money on drink. well the prince you understand that what follows took place in the presence of the sergeant major and a corporal the prince rated kolpakoff soundly and threatened to have him flogged. well kolpakoff went back to the barracks lay down on a camp bedstead and in a quarter of an hour was dead you quite understand it was as i said a strange almost impossible affair. in due course kolpakoff was buried the prince wrote his report the deceased s name was removed from the roll. all as it should be is it not but exactly three months later at the inspection of the brigade the man kolpakoff was found in the third company of the second battalion of infantry novozemlianski division just as if nothing had happened what said the prince much astonished. it did not occur it s a mistake said nina alexandrovna quickly looking at the prince rather anxiously. mon mari se trompe she added speaking in french. my dear se trompe is easily said. do you remember any case at all like it everybody was at their wits end. i should be the first to say qu on se trompe but unfortunately i was an eye witness and was also on the commission of inquiry. everything proved that it was really he the very same soldier kolpakoff who had been given the usual military funeral to the sound of the drum. it is of course a most curious case nearly an impossible one. i recognize that... but father your dinner is ready said varvara at this point putting her head in at the door. very glad i m particularly hungry. yes yes a strange coincidence almost a psychological your soup ll be cold do come. coming coming said the general. son of my old friend he was heard muttering as he went down the passage. you will have to excuse very much in my husband if you stay with us said nina alexandrovna but he will not disturb you often. he dines alone. everyone has his little peculiarities you know and some people perhaps have more than those who are most pointed at and laughed at. one thing i must beg of you if my husband applies to you for payment for board and lodging tell him that you have already paid me. of course anything paid by you to the general would be as fully settled as if paid to me so far as you are concerned but i wish it to be so if you please for convenience sake. what is it varia varia had quietly entered the room and was holding out the portrait of nastasia philipovna to her mother. nina alexandrovna started and examined the photograph intently gazing at it long and sadly. at last she looked up inquiringly at varia. it s a present from herself to him said varia the question is to be finally decided this evening. this evening repeated her mother in a tone of despair but softly as though to herself. then it s all settled of course and there s no hope left to us. she has anticipated her answer by the present of her portrait. did he show it you himself she added in some surprise. you know we have hardly spoken to each other for a whole month. ptitsin told me all about it and the photo was lying under the table and i picked it up. prince asked nina alexandrovna i wanted to inquire whether you have known my son long i think he said that you had only arrived today from somewhere. the prince gave a short narrative of what we have heard before leaving out the greater part. the two ladies listened intently. i did not ask about gania out of curiosity said the elder at last. i wish to know how much you know about him because he said just now that we need not stand on ceremony with you. what exactly does that mean at this moment gania and ptitsin entered the room together and nina alexandrovna immediately became silent again. the prince remained seated next to her but varia moved to the other end of the room the portrait of nastasia philipovna remained lying as before on the work table. gania observed it there and with a frown of annoyance snatched it up and threw it across to his writing table which stood at the other end of the room. is it today gania asked nina alexandrovna at last. is what today cried the former. then suddenly recollecting himself he turned sharply on the prince. oh he growled i see you are here that explains it is it a disease or what that you can t hold your tongue look here understand once for all prince i am to blame in this gania no one else said ptitsin. gania glanced inquiringly at the speaker. it s better so you know gania especially as from one point of view the matter may be considered as settled said ptitsin and sitting down a little way from the table he began to study a paper covered with pencil writing. gania stood and frowned he expected a family scene. he never thought of apologizing to the prince however. if it s all settled gania then of course mr. ptitsin is right said nina alexandrovna. don t frown. you need not worry yourself gania i shall ask you no questions. you need not tell me anything you don t like. i assure you i have quite submitted to your will. she said all this knitting away the while as though perfectly calm and composed. gania was surprised but cautiously kept silence and looked at his mother hoping that she would express herself more clearly. nina alexandrovna observed his cautiousness and added with a bitter smile you are still suspicious i see and do not believe me but you may be quite at your ease. there shall be no more tears nor questions not from my side at all events. all i wish is that you may be happy you know that. i have submitted to my fate but my heart will always be with you whether we remain united or whether we part. of course i only answer for myself you can hardly expect your sister my sister again cried gania looking at her with contempt and almost hate. look here mother i have already given you my word that i shall always respect you fully and absolutely and so shall everyone else in this house be it who it may who shall cross this threshold. gania was so much relieved that he gazed at his mother almost affectionately. i was not at all afraid for myself gania as you know well. it was not for my own sake that i have been so anxious and worried all this time they say it is all to be settled to day. what is to be settled she has promised to tell me tonight at her own house whether she consents or not replied gania. we have been silent on this subject for three weeks said his mother and it was better so and now i will only ask you one question. how can she give her consent and make you a present of her portrait when you do not love her how can such a such a practised hand eh i was not going to express myself so. but how could you so blind her nina alexandrovna s question betrayed intense annoyance. gania waited a moment and then said without taking the trouble to conceal the irony of his tone there you are mother you are always like that. you begin by promising that there are to be no reproaches or insinuations or questions and here you are beginning them at once. we had better drop the subject we had really. i shall never leave you mother any other man would cut and run from such a sister as this. see how she is looking at me at this moment besides how do you know that i am blinding nastasia philipovna as for varia i don t care she can do just as she pleases. there that s quite enough gania s irritation increased with every word he uttered as he walked up and down the room. these conversations always touched the family sores before long. i have said already that the moment she comes in i go out and i shall keep my word remarked varia. out of obstinacy shouted gania. you haven t married either thanks to your obstinacy. oh you needn t frown at me varvara you can go at once for all i care i am sick enough of your company. what you are going to leave us are you too he cried turning to the prince who was rising from his chair. gania s voice was full of the most uncontrolled and uncontrollable irritation. the prince turned at the door to say something but perceiving in gania s expression that there was but that one drop wanting to make the cup overflow he changed his mind and left the room without a word. a few minutes later he was aware from the noisy voices in the drawing room that the conversation had become more quarrelsome than ever after his departure. he crossed the salon and the entrance hall so as to pass down the corridor into his own room. as he came near the front door he heard someone outside vainly endeavouring to ring the bell which was evidently broken and only shook a little without emitting any sound. the prince took down the chain and opened the door. he started back in amazement for there stood nastasia philipovna. he knew her at once from her photograph. her eyes blazed with anger as she looked at him. she quickly pushed by him into the hall shouldering him out of her way and said furiously as she threw off her fur cloak if you are too lazy to mend your bell you should at least wait in the hall to let people in when they rattle the bell handle. there now you ve dropped my fur cloak dummy sure enough the cloak was lying on the ground. nastasia had thrown it off her towards the prince expecting him to catch it but the prince had missed it. now then announce me quick the prince wanted to say something but was so confused and astonished that he could not. however he moved off towards the drawing room with the cloak over his arm. now then where are you taking my cloak to ha ha ha are you mad the prince turned and came back more confused than ever. when she burst out laughing he smiled but his tongue could not form a word as yet. at first when he had opened the door and saw her standing before him he had become as pale as death but now the red blood had rushed back to his cheeks in a torrent. why what an idiot it is cried nastasia stamping her foot with irritation. go on do whom are you going to announce nastasia philipovna murmured the prince. and how do you know that she asked him sharply. i have never seen you before go on announce me what s that noise they are quarrelling said the prince and entered the drawing room just as matters in there had almost reached a crisis. nina alexandrovna had forgotten that she had submitted to everything she was defending varia. ptitsin was taking her part too. not that varia was afraid of standing up for herself. she was by no means that sort of a girl but her brother was becoming ruder and more intolerable every moment. her usual practice in such cases as the present was to say nothing but stare at him without taking her eyes off his face for an instant. this manoeuvre as she well knew could drive gania distracted. just at this moment the door opened and the prince entered announcing nastasia philipovna ix.\n"

      " start of the project gutenberg ebook the idiot the idiot by fyodor dostoyevsky translated by eva martin contents part I part ii part iii part iv part I i. towards the end of november during a thaw at nine o clock one morning a train on the warsaw and petersburg railway was approaching the latter city at full speed. the morning was so damp and misty that it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the carriage windows. some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad but the third class carriages were the best filled chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees picked up at the different stations nearer town. all of them seemed weary and most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression while their complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside. when day dawned two passengers in one of the third class carriages found themselves opposite each other. both were young fellows both were rather poorly dressed both had remarkable faces and both were evidently anxious to start a conversation. if they had but known why at this particular moment they were both remarkable persons they would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set them down opposite to one another in a third class carriage of the warsaw railway company. one of them was a young fellow of about twenty seven not tall with black curling hair and small grey fiery eyes. his nose was broad and flat and he had high cheek bones his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent ironical it might almost be called a malicious smile but his forehead was high and well formed and atoned for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. a special feature of this physiognomy was its death like pallor which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent sarcastic smile and keen self satisfied bearing. he wore a large fur or rather astrachan overcoat which had kept him warm all night while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a russian november night entirely unprepared. his wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the winter months in switzerland or north italy was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through russia from eydkuhnen to st. petersburg. the wearer of this cloak was a young fellow also of about twenty six or twenty seven years of age slightly above the middle height very fair with a thin pointed and very light coloured beard his eyes were large and blue and had an intent look about them yet that heavy expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence of an epileptic subject. his face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that refined but quite colourless except for the circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold. he held a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe and wore thick shoes and gaiters his whole appearance being very un russian. his black haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities having nothing better to do and at length remarked with that rude enjoyment of the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show cold very said his neighbour readily and this is a thaw too. fancy if it had been a hard frost I never thought it would be so cold in the old country. I ve grown quite out of the way of it. what been abroad I suppose yes straight from switzerland. wheugh my goodness the black haired young fellow whistled and then laughed. the conversation proceeded. the readiness of the fair haired young man in the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbour s questions was surprising. he seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him. replying to them he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had been long absent from russia more than four years that he had been sent abroad for his health that he had suffered from some strange nervous malady a kind of epilepsy with convulsive spasms. his interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers and more than ever when to the question whether he had been cured the patient replied no they did not cure me. hey that s it you stumped up your money for nothing and we believe in those fellows here remarked the black haired individual sarcastically. gospel truth sir gospel truth exclaimed another passenger a shabbily dressed man of about forty who looked like a clerk and possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face. gospel truth all they do is to get hold of our good russian money free gratis and for nothing. oh but you re quite wrong in my particular instance said the swiss patient quietly. of course I can t argue the matter because I know only my own case but my doctor gave me money and he had very little to pay my journey back besides having kept me at his own expense while there for nearly two years. why was there no one else to pay for you asked the black haired one. no mr. pavlicheff who had been supporting me there died a couple of years ago. I wrote to mrs. general epanchin at the time she is a distant relative of mine but she did not answer my letter. and so eventually I came back. and where have you come to that is where am I going to stay I i really don t quite know yet I both the listeners laughed again. I suppose your whole set up is in that bundle then asked the first. I bet anything it is exclaimed the red nosed passenger with extreme satisfaction and that he has precious little in the luggage van though of course poverty is no crime we must remember that it appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. the young fellow hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness. your bundle has some importance however continued the clerk when they had laughed their fill it was observable that the subject of their mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing for though I dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs d or and louis d or judge from your costume and gaiters still if you can add to your possessions such a valuable property as a relation like mrs. general epanchin then your bundle becomes a significant object at once. that is of course if you really are a relative of mrs. epanchin s and have not made a little error through well absence of mind which is very common to human beings or say through a too luxuriant fancy oh you are right again said the fair haired traveller for I really am almost wrong when I say she and I are related. she is hardly a relation at all so little in fact that I was not in the least surprised to have no answer to my letter. I expected as much. h m you spent your postage for nothing then. h m you are candid however and that is commendable. h m mrs. epanchin oh yes a most eminent person. I know her. as for mr. pavlicheff who supported you in switzerland I know him too at least if it was nicolai andreevitch of that name a fine fellow he was and had a property of four thousand souls in his day. yes nicolai andreevitch that was his name and the young fellow looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all knowing gentleman with the red nose. this sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class. they are people who know everyone that is they know where a man is employed what his salary is whom he knows whom he married what money his wife had who are his cousins and second cousins etc. etc. these men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on and they spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style of knowledge which they reduce or raise to the standard of a science. during the latter part of the conversation the black haired young man had become very impatient. he stared out of the window and fidgeted and evidently longed for the end of the journey. he was very absent he would appear to listen and heard nothing and he would laugh of a sudden evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about. excuse me said the red nosed man to the young fellow with the bundle rather suddenly whom have I the honour to be talking to prince lef nicolaievitch muishkin replied the latter with perfect readiness. prince muishkin lef nicolaievitch h m I don t know I m sure I may say I have never heard of such a person said the clerk thoughtfully. at least the name I admit is historical. karamsin must mention the family name of course in his history but as an individual one never hears of any prince muishkin nowadays. of course not replied the prince there are none except myself. I believe I am the last and only one. as to my forefathers they have always been a poor lot my own father was a sublieutenant in the army. I don t know how mrs. epanchin comes into the muishkin family but she is descended from the princess muishkin and she too is the last of her line. and did you learn science and all that with your professor over there asked the black haired passenger. oh yes I did learn a little but I ve never learned anything whatever said the other. oh but I learned very little you know added the prince as though excusing himself. they could not teach me very much on account of my illness. do you know the rogojins asked his questioner abruptly. no I don t not at all I hardly know anyone in russia. why is that your name yes I am rogojin parfen rogojin. parfen rogojin dear me then don t you belong to those very rogojins perhaps began the clerk with a very perceptible increase of civility in his tone. yes those very ones interrupted rogojin impatiently and with scant courtesy. I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the blotchy faced passenger and had hitherto addressed all his remarks direct to the prince. dear me is it possible observed the clerk while his face assumed an expression of great deference and servility if not of absolute alarm what a son of that very semen rogojin hereditary honourable citizen who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of roubles and how do you know that he left two million and a half of roubles asked rogojin disdainfully and not deigning so much as to look at the other. however it s true enough that my father died a month ago and that here am I returning from pskoff a month after with hardly a boot to my foot. they ve treated me like a dog I ve been ill of fever at pskoff the whole time and not a line nor farthing of money have I received from my mother or my confounded brother and now you ll have a million roubles at least goodness gracious me exclaimed the clerk rubbing his hands. five weeks since I was just like yourself continued rogojin addressing the prince with nothing but a bundle and the clothes I wore. I ran away from my father and came to pskoff to my aunt s house where I caved in at once with fever and he went and died while I was away. all honour to my respected father s memory but he uncommonly nearly killed me all the same. give you my word prince if I hadn t cut and run then when I did he d have murdered me like a dog. I suppose you angered him somehow asked the prince looking at the millionaire with considerable curiosity. but though there may have been something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the prince more than that. rogojin too seemed to have taken up the conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a considerable state of excitement if not absolutely feverish and was in real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking as safety valve to his agitation. as for his red nosed neighbour the latter since the information as to the identity of rogojin hung over him seemed to be living on the honey of his words and in the breath of his nostrils catching at every syllable as though it were a pearl of great price. oh yes I angered him I certainly did anger him replied rogojin. but what puts me out so is my brother. of course my mother couldn t do anything she s too old and whatever brother senka says is law for her but why couldn t he let me know he sent a telegram they say. what s the good of a telegram it frightened my aunt so that she sent it back to the office unopened and there it s been ever since it s only thanks to konief that I heard at all he wrote me all about it. he says my brother cut off the gold tassels from my father s coffin at night because they re worth a lot of money says he. why I can get him sent off to siberia for that alone if I like it s sacrilege. here you scarecrow he added addressing the clerk at his side is it sacrilege or not by law sacrilege certainly certainly sacrilege said the latter. and it s siberia for sacrilege isn t it undoubtedly so siberia of course they will think that I m still ill continued rogojin to the prince but I sloped off quietly seedy as I was took the train and came away. aha brother senka you ll have to open your gates and let me in my boy I know he told tales about me to my father I know that well enough but I certainly did rile my father about nastasia philipovna that s very sure and that was my own doing. nastasia philipovna said the clerk as though trying to think out something. come you know nothing about her said rogojin impatiently. and supposing I do know something observed the other triumphantly. bosh there are plenty of nastasia philipovnas. and what an impertinent beast you are he added angrily. I thought some creature like you would hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money. oh but I do know as it happens said the clerk in an aggravating manner. lebedeff knows all about her. you are pleased to reproach me your excellency but what if I prove that I am right after all nastasia philipovna s family name is barashkoff I know you see and she is a very well known lady indeed and comes of a good family too. she is connected with one totski afanasy ivanovitch a man of considerable property a director of companies and so on and a great friend of general epanchin who is interested in the same matters as he is. my eyes said rogojin really surprised at last. the devil take the fellow how does he know that why he knows everything lebedeff knows everything I was a month or two with lihachof after his father died your excellency and while he was knocking about he s in the debtor s prison now I was with him and he couldn t do a thing without lebedeff and I got to know nastasia philipovna and several people at that time. nastasia philipovna why you don t mean to say that she and lihachof cried rogojin turning quite pale. no no no no no nothing of the sort I assure you said lebedeff hastily. oh dear no not for the world totski s the only man with any chance there. oh no he takes her to his box at the opera at the french theatre of an evening and the officers and people all look at her and say by jove there s the famous nastasia philipovna but no one ever gets any further than that for there is nothing more to say. yes it s quite true said rogojin frowning gloomily so zaleshoff told me. I was walking about the nefsky one fine day prince in my father s old coat when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped into her carriage. I swear I was all of a blaze at once. then I met zaleshoff looking like a hair dresser s assistant got up as fine as I don t know who while I looked like a tinker. don t flatter yourself my boy said he she s not for such as you she s a princess she is and her name is nastasia philipovna barashkoff and she lives with totski who wishes to get rid of her because he s growing rather old fifty five or so and wants to marry a certain beauty the loveliest woman in all petersburg. and then he told me that I could see nastasia philipovna at the opera house that evening if I liked and described which was her box. well I d like to see my father allowing any of us to go to the theatre he d sooner have killed us any day. however I went for an hour or so and saw nastasia philipovna and I never slept a wink all night after. next morning my father happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell worth nearly five thousand roubles each. sell them said he and then take seven thousand five hundred roubles to the office give them to the cashier and bring me back the rest of the ten thousand without looking in anywhere on the way look sharp I shall be waiting for you. well I sold the bonds but I didn t take the seven thousand roubles to the office I went straight to the english shop and chose a pair of earrings with a diamond the size of a nut in each. they cost four hundred roubles more than I had so I gave my name and they trusted me. with the earrings I went at once to zaleshoff s. come on I said come on to nastasia philipovna s and off we went without more ado. I tell you I hadn t a notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way I saw nothing whatever. we went straight into her drawing room and then she came out to us. I didn t say right out who I was but zaleshoff said from parfen rogojin in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday be so kind as to accept these she opened the parcel looked at the earrings and laughed. thank your friend mr. rogojin for his kind attention says she and bowed and went off. why didn t I die there on the spot the worst of it all was though that the beast zaleshoff got all the credit of it I was short and abominably dressed and stood and stared in her face and never said a word because I was shy like an ass and there was he all in the fashion pomaded and dressed out with a smart tie on bowing and scraping and I bet anything she took him for me all the while look here now I said when we came out none of your interference here after this do you understand he laughed and how are you going to settle up with your father says he. I thought I might as well jump into the neva at once without going home first but it struck me that I wouldn t after all and I went home feeling like one of the damned. my goodness shivered the clerk. and his father he added for the prince s instruction and his father would have given a man a ticket to the other world for ten roubles any day not to speak of ten thousand the prince observed rogojin with great curiosity he seemed paler than ever at this moment. what do you know about it cried the latter. well my father learned the whole story at once and zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town besides. so he took me upstairs and locked me up and swore at me for an hour. this is only a foretaste says he wait a bit till night comes and I ll come back and talk to you again. well what do you think the old fellow went straight off to nastasia philipovna touched the floor with his forehead and began blubbering and beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds. so after awhile she brought the box and flew out at him. there she says take your earrings you wretched old miser although they are ten times dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must have cost parfen to get them give parfen my compliments she says and thank him very much well I meanwhile had borrowed twenty five roubles from a friend and off I went to pskoff to my aunt s. the old woman there lectured me so that I left the house and went on a drinking tour round the public houses of the place. I was in a high fever when I got to pskoff and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets somewhere or other oho we ll make nastasia philipovna sing another song now giggled lebedeff rubbing his hands with glee. hey my boy we ll get her some proper earrings now we ll get her such earrings that look here cried rogojin seizing him fiercely by the arm look here if you so much as name nastasia philipovna again I ll tan your hide as sure as you sit there aha do by all means if you tan my hide you won t turn me away from your society. you ll bind me to you with your lash for ever. ha ha here we are at the station though. sure enough the train was just steaming in as he spoke. though rogojin had declared that he left pskoff secretly a large collection of friends had assembled to greet him and did so with profuse waving of hats and shouting. why there s zaleshoff here too he muttered gazing at the scene with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile. then he suddenly turned to the prince prince I don t know why I have taken a fancy to you perhaps because I met you just when I did. but no it can t be that for I met this fellow nodding at lebedeff too and I have not taken a fancy to him by any means. come to see me prince we ll take off those gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat the best we can buy. you shall have a dress coat best quality white waistcoat anything you like and your pocket shall be full of money. come and you shall go with me to nastasia philipovna s. now then will you come or no accept accept prince lef nicolaievitch said lebedef solemnly don t let it slip accept quick prince muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously while he replied with some cordiality I will come with the greatest pleasure and thank you very much for taking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even come today if I have time for I tell you frankly that I like you very much too. I liked you especially when you told us about the diamond earrings but I liked you before that as well though you have such a dark clouded sort of face. thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat I certainly shall require both clothes and coat very soon. as for money I have hardly a copeck about me at this moment. you shall have lots of money by the evening I shall have plenty so come along that s true enough he ll have lots before evening put in lebedeff. but look here are you a great hand with the ladies let s know that first asked rogojin. oh no oh no said the prince I couldn t you know my illness I hardly ever saw a soul. h m well here you fellow you can come along with me now if you like cried rogojin to lebedeff and so they all left the carriage. lebedeff had his desire. he went off with the noisy group of rogojin s friends towards the voznesensky while the prince s route lay towards the litaynaya. it was damp and wet. the prince asked his way of passers by and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his destination he determined to take a droshky. ii. general epanchin lived in his own house near the litaynaya. besides this large residence five sixths of which was let in flats and lodgings the general was owner of another enormous house in the sadovaya bringing in even more rent than the first. besides these houses he had a delightful little estate just out of town and some sort of factory in another part of the city. general epanchin as everyone knew had a good deal to do with certain government monopolies he was also a voice and an important one in many rich public companies of various descriptions in fact he enjoyed the reputation of being a well to do man of busy habits many ties and affluent means. he had made himself indispensable in several quarters amongst others in his department of the government and yet it was a known fact that fedor ivanovitch epanchin was a man of no education whatever and had absolutely risen from the ranks. this last fact could of course reflect nothing but credit upon the general and yet though unquestionably a sagacious man he had his own little weaknesses very excusable ones one of which was a dislike to any allusion to the above circumstance. he was undoubtedly clever. for instance he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain more by keeping in the background and in consequence many exalted personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity and because he knew his place. and yet if these good people could only have had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who knew his place so well the fact is that in spite of his knowledge of the world and his really remarkable abilities he always liked to appear to be carrying out other people s ideas rather than his own. and also his luck seldom failed him even at cards for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to conceal. he played for high stakes and moved altogether in very varied society. as to age general epanchin was in the very prime of life that is about fifty five years of age the flowering time of existence when real enjoyment of life begins. his healthy appearance good colour sound though discoloured teeth sturdy figure preoccupied air during business hours and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the evening all bore witness to his success in life and combined to make existence a bed of roses to his excellency. the general was lord of a flourishing family consisting of his wife and three grown up daughters. he had married young while still a lieutenant his wife being a girl of about his own age who possessed neither beauty nor education and who brought him no more than fifty souls of landed property which little estate served however as a nest egg for far more important accumulations. the general never regretted his early marriage or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade and he so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her. mrs. epanchin came of the princely stock of muishkin which if not a brilliant was at all events a decidedly ancient family and she was extremely proud of her descent. with a few exceptions the worthy couple had lived through their long union very happily. while still young the wife had been able to make important friends among the aristocracy partly by virtue of her family descent and partly by her own exertions while in after life thanks to their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service she took her place among the higher circles as by right. during these last few years all three of the general s daughters alexandra adelaida and aglaya had grown up and matured. of course they were only epanchins but their mother s family was noble they might expect considerable fortunes their father had hopes of attaining to very high rank indeed in his country s service all of which was satisfactory. all three of the girls were decidedly pretty even the eldest alexandra who was just twenty five years old. the middle daughter was now twenty three while the youngest aglaya was twenty. this youngest girl was absolutely a beauty and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in society. but this was not all for every one of the three was clever well educated and accomplished. it was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very fond of one another and supported each other in every way it was even said that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake of the idol of the household aglaya. in society they not only disliked asserting themselves but were actually retiring. certainly no one could blame them for being too arrogant or haughty and yet everybody was well aware that they were proud and quite understood their own value. the eldest was musical while the second was a clever artist which fact she had concealed until lately. in a word the world spoke well of the girls but they were not without their enemies and occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had read. they were in no hurry to marry. they liked good society but were not too keen about it. all this was the more remarkable because everyone was well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents. it was about eleven o clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the bell at general epanchin s door. the general lived on the first floor or flat of the house as modest a lodging as his position permitted. a liveried servant opened the door and the prince was obliged to enter into long explanations with this gentleman who from the first glance looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion. at last however on the repeated positive assurance that he really was prince muishkin and must absolutely see the general on business the bewildered domestic showed him into a little ante chamber leading to a waiting room that adjoined the general s study there handing him over to another servant whose duty it was to be in this ante chamber all the morning and announce visitors to the general. this second individual wore a dress coat and was some forty years of age he was the general s special study servant and well aware of his own importance. wait in the next room please and leave your bundle here said the door keeper as he sat down comfortably in his own easy chair in the ante chamber. he looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter settled himself in another chair alongside with his bundle on his knees. if you don t mind I would rather sit here with you said the prince I should prefer it to sitting in there. oh but you can t stay here. you are a visitor a guest so to speak. is it the general himself you wish to see the man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby looking visitor and had decided to ask once more. yes I have business began the prince. I do not ask you what your business may be all I have to do is to announce you and unless the secretary comes in here I cannot do that. the man s suspicions seemed to increase more and more. the prince was too unlike the usual run of daily visitors and although the general certainly did receive on business all sorts and conditions of men yet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular visitor. the presence of the secretary as an intermediary was he judged essential in this case. surely you are from abroad he inquired at last in a confused sort of way. he had begun his sentence intending to say surely you are not prince muishkin are you yes straight from the train did not you intend to say surely you are not prince muishkin just now but refrained out of politeness h m grunted the astonished servant. I assure you I am not deceiving you you shall not have to answer for me. as to my being dressed like this and carrying a bundle there s nothing surprising in that the fact is my circumstances are not particularly rosy at this moment. h m no I m not afraid of that you see I have to announce you that s all. the secretary will be out directly that is unless you yes that s the rub unless you come you must allow me to ask you you ve not come to beg have you oh dear no you can be perfectly easy on that score. I have quite another matter on hand. you must excuse my asking you know. your appearance led me to think but just wait for the secretary the general is busy now but the secretary is sure to come out. oh well look here if I have some time to wait would you mind telling me is there any place about where I could have a smoke I have my pipe and tobacco with me. smoke said the man in shocked but disdainful surprise blinking his eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses. no sir you cannot smoke here and I wonder you are not ashamed of the very suggestion. ha ha a cool idea that I declare oh I didn t mean in this room I know I can t smoke here of course. I d adjourn to some other room wherever you like to show me to. you see I m used to smoking a good deal and now I haven t had a puff for three hours however just as you like. now how on earth am I to announce a man like that muttered the servant. in the first place you ve no right in here at all you ought to be in the waiting room because you re a sort of visitor a guest in fact and I shall catch it for this. look here do you intend to take up you abode with us he added glancing once more at the prince s bundle which evidently gave him no peace. no I don t think so. I don t think I should stay even if they were to invite me. I ve simply come to make their acquaintance and nothing more. make their acquaintance asked the man in amazement and with redoubled suspicion. then why did you say you had business with the general oh well very little business. there is one little matter some advice I am going to ask him for but my principal object is simply to introduce myself because I am prince muishkin and madame epanchin is the last of her branch of the house and besides herself and me there are no other muishkins left. what you re a relation then are you asked the servant so bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed. well hardly so. if you stretch a point we are relations of course but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once wrote to your mistress from abroad but she did not reply. however I have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. I am telling you all this in order to ease your mind for I see you are still far from comfortable on my account. all you have to do is to announce me as prince muishkin and the object of my visit will be plain enough. if I am received very good if not well very good again. but they are sure to receive me I should think madame epanchin will naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of her family. she values her muishkin descent very highly if I am rightly informed. the prince s conversation was artless and confiding to a degree and the servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common serving man this state of things was highly improper. his conclusion was that one of two things must be the explanation either that this was a begging impostor or that the prince if prince he were was simply a fool without the slightest ambition for a sensible prince with any ambition would certainly not wait about in ante rooms with servants and talk of his own private affairs like this. in either case how was he to announce this singular visitor I really think I must request you to step into the next room he said with all the insistence he could muster. why if I had been sitting there now I should not have had the opportunity of making these personal explanations. I see you are still uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle. don t you think you might go in yourself now without waiting for the secretary to come out no no I can t announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary. besides the general said he was not to be disturbed he is with the colonel c . gavrila ardalionovitch goes in without announcing. who may that be a clerk what gavrila ardalionovitch oh no he belongs to one of the companies. look here at all events put your bundle down here. yes I will if I may and can I take off my cloak of course you can t go in there with it on anyhow. the prince rose and took off his mantle revealing a neat enough morning costume a little worn but well made. he wore a steel watch chain and from this chain there hung a silver geneva watch. fool the prince might be still the general s servant felt that it was not correct for him to continue to converse thus with a visitor in spite of the fact that the prince pleased him somehow. and what time of day does the lady receive the latter asked reseating himself in his old place. oh that s not in my province I believe she receives at any time it depends upon the visitors. the dressmaker goes in at eleven. gavrila ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people too he is even admitted to early lunch now and then. it is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season observed the prince but it is much warmer there out of doors. as for the houses a russian can t live in them in the winter until he gets accustomed to them. don t they heat them at all well they do heat them a little but the houses and stoves are so different to ours. h m were you long away four years and I was in the same place nearly all the time in one village. you must have forgotten russia hadn t you yes indeed I had a good deal and would you believe it I often wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak russian even now as I talk to you I keep saying to myself how well I am speaking it. perhaps that is partly why I am so talkative this morning. I assure you ever since yesterday evening I have had the strongest desire to go on and on talking russian. h m yes did you live in petersburg in former years this good flunkey in spite of his conscientious scruples really could not resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation. in petersburg oh no hardly at all and now they say so much is changed in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged to relearn what they knew. they talk a good deal about the new law courts and changes there don t they h m yes that s true enough. well now how is the law over there do they administer it more justly than here oh I don t know about that I ve heard much that is good about our legal administration too. there is no capital punishment here for one thing. is there over there yes I saw an execution in france at lyons. schneider took me over with him to see it. what did they hang the fellow no they cut off people s heads in france. what did the fellow do yell oh no it s the work of an instant. they put a man inside a frame and a sort of broad knife falls by machinery they call the thing a guillotine it falls with fearful force and weight the head springs off so quickly that you can t wink your eye in between. but all the preparations are so dreadful. when they announce the sentence you know and prepare the criminal and tie his hands and cart him off to the scaffold that s the fearful part of the business. the people all crowd round even women though they don t at all approve of women looking on. no it s not a thing for women. of course not of course not bah the criminal was a fine intelligent fearless man le gros was his name and I may tell you believe it or not as you like that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he cried he did indeed he was as white as a bit of paper. isn t it a dreadful idea that he should have cried cried whoever heard of a grown man crying from fear not a child but a man who never had cried before a grown man of forty five years. imagine what must have been going on in that man s mind at such a moment what dreadful convulsions his whole spirit must have endured it is an outrage on the soul that s what it is. because it is said thou shalt not kill is he to be killed because he murdered some one else no it is not right it s an impossible theory. I assure you I saw the sight a month ago and it s dancing before my eyes to this moment. I dream of it often. the prince had grown animated as he spoke and a tinge of colour suffused his pale face though his way of talking was as quiet as ever. the servant followed his words with sympathetic interest. clearly he was not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end. who knows perhaps he too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for thought. well at all events it is a good thing that there s no pain when the poor fellow s head flies off he remarked. do you know though cried the prince warmly you made that remark now and everyone says the same thing and the machine is designed with the purpose of avoiding pain this guillotine I mean but a thought came into my head then what if it be a bad plan after all you may laugh at my idea perhaps but I could not help its occurring to me all the same. now with the rack and tortures and so on you suffer terrible pain of course but then your torture is bodily pain only although no doubt you have plenty of that until you die. but here I should imagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment is not the bodily pain at all but the certain knowledge that in an hour then in ten minutes then in half a minute then now this very instant your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man and that this is certain certain that s the point the certainty of it. just that instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate over your head then that quarter of a second is the most awful of all. this is not my own fantastical opinion many people have thought the same but I feel it so deeply that I ll tell you what I think. I believe that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. a murder by sentence is far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. the man who is attacked by robbers at night in a dark wood or anywhere undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death. there are plenty of instances of a man running away or imploring for mercy at all events hoping on in some degree even after his throat was cut. but in the case of an execution that last hope having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die is taken away from the wretch and certainty substituted in its place there is his sentence and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death which I consider must be the most dreadful anguish in the world. you may place a soldier before a cannon s mouth in battle and fire upon him and he will still hope. but read to that same soldier his death sentence and he will either go mad or burst into tears. who dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad no no it is an abuse a shame it is unnecessary why should such a thing exist doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced who have suffered this mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards. our lord christ spoke of this anguish and dread. no no no no man should be treated so no man no man the servant though of course he could not have expressed all this as the prince did still clearly entered into it and was greatly conciliated as was evident from the increased amiability of his expression. if you are really very anxious for a smoke he remarked I think it might possibly be managed if you are very quick about it. you see they might come out and inquire for you and you wouldn t be on the spot. you see that door there go in there and you ll find a little room on the right you can smoke there only open the window because I ought not to allow it really and . but there was no time after all. a young fellow entered the ante room at this moment with a bundle of papers in his hand. the footman hastened to help him take off his overcoat. the new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of his eyes. this gentleman declares gavrila ardalionovitch began the man confidentially and almost familiarly that he is prince muishkin and a relative of madame epanchin s. he has just arrived from abroad with nothing but a bundle by way of luggage . the prince did not hear the rest because at this point the servant continued his communication in a whisper. gavrila ardalionovitch listened attentively and gazed at the prince with great curiosity. at last he motioned the man aside and stepped hurriedly towards the prince. are you prince muishkin he asked with the greatest courtesy and amiability. he was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty eight summers fair and of middle height he wore a small beard and his face was most intelligent. yet his smile in spite of its sweetness was a little thin if I may so call it and showed his teeth too evenly his gaze though decidedly good humoured and ingenuous was a trifle too inquisitive and intent to be altogether agreeable. probably when he is alone he looks quite different and hardly smiles at all thought the prince. he explained about himself in a few words very much the same as he had told the footman and rogojin beforehand. gavrila ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall something. was it not you then who sent a letter a year or less ago from switzerland I think it was to elizabetha prokofievna mrs. epanchin it was. oh then of course they will remember who you are. you wish to see the general I ll tell him at once he will be free in a minute but you you had better wait in the ante chamber hadn t you why is he here he added severely to the man. I tell you sir he wished it himself at this moment the study door opened and a military man with a portfolio under his arm came out talking loudly and after bidding good bye to someone inside took his departure. you there gania cried a voice from the study come in here will you gavrila ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room hastily. a couple of minutes later the door opened again and the affable voice of gania cried come in please prince iii. general ivan fedorovitch epanchin was standing in the middle of the room and gazed with great curiosity at the prince as he entered. he even advanced a couple of steps to meet him. the prince came forward and introduced himself. quite so replied the general and what can I do for you oh I have no special business my principal object was to make your acquaintance. I should not like to disturb you. I do not know your times and arrangements here you see but I have only just arrived. I came straight from the station. I am come direct from switzerland. the general very nearly smiled but thought better of it and kept his smile back. then he reflected blinked his eyes stared at his guest once more from head to foot then abruptly motioned him to a chair sat down himself and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak. gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room turning over papers. I have not much time for making acquaintances as a rule said the general but as of course you have your object in coming I i felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved to pay you this visit the prince interrupted but I give you my word beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal object whatever. the pleasure is of course mutual but life is not all pleasure as you are aware. there is such a thing as business and I really do not see what possible reason there can be or what we have in common to oh there is no reason of course and I suppose there is nothing in common between us or very little for if I am prince muishkin and your wife happens to be a member of my house that can hardly be called a reason. I quite understand that. and yet that was my whole motive for coming. you see I have not been in russia for four years and knew very little about anything when I left. I had been very ill for a long time and I feel now the need of a few good friends. in fact I have a certain question upon which I much need advice and do not know whom to go to for it. I thought of your family when I was passing through berlin. they are almost relations I said to myself so I ll begin with them perhaps we may get on with each other I with them and they with me if they are kind people and I have heard that you are very kind people oh thank you thank you I m sure replied the general considerably taken aback. may I ask where you have taken up your quarters nowhere as yet. what straight from the station to my house and how about your luggage I only had a small bundle containing linen with me nothing more. I can carry it in my hand easily. there will be plenty of time to take a room in some hotel by the evening. oh then you do intend to take a room of course. to judge from your words you came straight to my house with the intention of staying there. that could only have been on your invitation. I confess however that I should not have stayed here even if you had invited me not for any particular reason but because it is well contrary to my practice and nature somehow. oh indeed then it is perhaps as well that I neither did invite you nor do invite you now. excuse me prince but we had better make this matter clear once for all. we have just agreed that with regard to our relationship there is not much to be said though of course it would have been very delightful to us to feel that such relationship did actually exist therefore perhaps therefore perhaps I had better get up and go away said the prince laughing merrily as he rose from his place just as merrily as though the circumstances were by no means strained or difficult. and I give you my word general that though I know nothing whatever of manners and customs of society and how people live and all that yet I felt quite sure that this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended now. oh well I suppose it s all right especially as my letter was not answered. well good bye and forgive me for having disturbed you the prince s expression was so good natured at this moment and so entirely free from even a suspicion of unpleasant feeling was the smile with which he looked at the general as he spoke that the latter suddenly paused and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new point of view all in an instant. do you know prince he said in quite a different tone I do not know you at all yet and after all elizabetha prokofievna would very likely be pleased to have a peep at a man of her own name. wait a little if you don t mind and if you have time to spare oh I assure you I ve lots of time my time is entirely my own and the prince immediately replaced his soft round hat on the table. I confess I thought elizabetha prokofievna would very likely remember that I had written her a letter. just now your servant outside there was dreadfully suspicious that I had come to beg of you. I noticed that probably he has very strict instructions on that score but I assure you I did not come to beg. I came to make some friends. but I am rather bothered at having disturbed you that s all I care about. look here prince said the general with a cordial smile if you really are the sort of man you appear to be it may be a source of great pleasure to us to make your better acquaintance but you see I am a very busy man and have to be perpetually sitting here and signing papers or off to see his excellency or to my department or somewhere so that though I should be glad to see more of people nice people you see I however I am sure you are so well brought up that you will see at once and but how old are you prince twenty six. no I thought you very much younger. yes they say I have a young face. as to disturbing you I shall soon learn to avoid doing that for I hate disturbing people. besides you and I are so differently constituted I should think that there must be very little in common between us. not that I will ever believe there is nothing in common between any two people as some declare is the case. I am sure people make a great mistake in sorting each other into groups by appearances but I am boring you I see you just two words have you any means at all or perhaps you may be intending to undertake some sort of employment excuse my questioning you but oh my dear sir I esteem and understand your kindness in putting the question. no at present I have no means whatever and no employment either but I hope to find some. I was living on other people abroad. schneider the professor who treated me and taught me too in switzerland gave me just enough money for my journey so that now I have but a few copecks left. there certainly is one question upon which I am anxious to have advice but tell me how do you intend to live now and what are your plans interrupted the general. I wish to work somehow or other. oh yes but then you see you are a philosopher. have you any talents or ability in any direction that is any that would bring in money and bread excuse me again oh don t apologize. no I don t think I have either talents or special abilities of any kind on the contrary. I have always been an invalid and unable to learn much. as for bread I should think the general interrupted once more with questions while the prince again replied with the narrative we have heard before. it appeared that the general had known pavlicheff but why the latter had taken an interest in the prince that young gentleman could not explain probably by virtue of the old friendship with his father he thought. the prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child and pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady a relative of his own living in the country the child needing the fresh air and exercise of country life. he was educated first by a governess and afterwards by a tutor but could not remember much about this time of his life. his fits were so frequent then that they made almost an idiot of him the prince used the expression idiot himself . pavlicheff had met professor schneider in berlin and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy to switzerland to schneider s establishment there for the cure of his epilepsy and five years before this time the prince was sent off. but pavlicheff had died two or three years since and schneider had himself supported the young fellow from that day to this at his own expense. although he had not quite cured him he had greatly improved his condition and now at last at the prince s own desire and because of a certain matter which came to the ears of the latter schneider had despatched the young man to russia. the general was much astonished. then you have no one absolutely no one in russia he asked. no one at present but I hope to make friends and then I have a letter from at all events put in the general not listening to the news about the letter at all events you must have learned something and your malady would not prevent your undertaking some easy work in one of the departments for instance oh dear no oh no as for a situation I should much like to find one for I am anxious to discover what I really am fit for. I have learned a good deal in the last four years and besides I read a great many russian books. russian books indeed then of course you can read and write quite correctly oh dear yes capital and your handwriting ah there I am really talented I may say I am a real caligraphist. let me write you something just to show you said the prince with some excitement. with pleasure in fact it is very necessary. I like your readiness prince in fact I must say I i like you very well altogether said the general. what delightful writing materials you have here such a lot of pencils and things and what beautiful paper it s a charming room altogether. I know that picture it s a swiss view. I m sure the artist painted it from nature and that I have seen the very place quite likely though I bought it here. gania give the prince some paper. here are pens and paper now then take this table. what s this the general continued to gania who had that moment taken a large photograph out of his portfolio and shown it to his senior. halloa nastasia philipovna did she send it you herself herself he inquired with much curiosity and great animation. she gave it me just now when I called in to congratulate her. I asked her for it long ago. I don t know whether she meant it for a hint that I had come empty handed without a present for her birthday or what added gania with an unpleasant smile. oh nonsense nonsense said the general with decision. what extraordinary ideas you have gania as if she would hint that s not her way at all. besides what could you give her without having thousands at your disposal you might have given her your portrait however. has she ever asked you for it no not yet. very likely she never will. I suppose you haven t forgotten about tonight have you ivan fedorovitch you were one of those specially invited you know. oh no I remember all right and I shall go of course. I should think so she s twenty five years old today and you know gania you must be ready for great things she has promised both myself and afanasy ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight yes or no. so be prepared gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than ever. are you sure she said that he asked and his voice seemed to quiver as he spoke. yes she promised. we both worried her so that she gave in but she wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day. the general watched gania s confusion intently and clearly did not like it. remember ivan fedorovitch said gania in great agitation that I was to be free too until her decision and that even then I was to have my yes or no free. why don t you aren t you began the general in alarm. oh don t misunderstand but my dear fellow what are you doing what do you mean oh I m not rejecting her. I may have expressed myself badly but I didn t mean that. reject her I should think not said the general with annoyance and apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it. why my dear fellow it s not a question of your rejecting her it is whether you are prepared to receive her consent joyfully and with proper satisfaction. how are things going on at home at home oh I can do as I like there of course only my father will make a fool of himself as usual. he is rapidly becoming a general nuisance. I don t ever talk to him now but I hold him in check safe enough. I swear if it had not been for my mother I should have shown him the way out long ago. my mother is always crying of course and my sister sulks. I had to tell them at last that I intended to be master of my own destiny and that I expect to be obeyed at home. at least I gave my sister to understand as much and my mother was present. well I must say I cannot understand it said the general shrugging his shoulders and dropping his hands. you remember your mother nina alexandrovna that day she came and sat here and groaned and when I asked her what was the matter she says oh it s such a dishonour to us dishonour stuff and nonsense I should like to know who can reproach nastasia philipovna or who can say a word of any kind against her. did she mean because nastasia had been living with totski what nonsense it is you would not let her come near your daughters says nina alexandrovna. what next I wonder I don t see how she can fail to to understand her own position prompted gania. she does understand. don t be annoyed with her. I have warned her not to meddle in other people s affairs. however although there s comparative peace at home at present the storm will break if anything is finally settled tonight. the prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation as he sat at the table writing. he finished at last and brought the result of his labour to the general s desk. so this is nastasia philipovna he said looking attentively and curiously at the portrait. how wonderfully beautiful he immediately added with warmth. the picture was certainly that of an unusually lovely woman. she was photographed in a black silk dress of simple design her hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged her eyes were deep and thoughtful the expression of her face passionate but proud. she was rather thin perhaps and a little pale. both gania and the general gazed at the prince in amazement. how do you know it s nastasia philipovna asked the general you surely don t know her already do you yes I do I have only been one day in russia but I have heard of the great beauty and the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with rogojin in the train and the whole of the latter s story. there s news said the general in some excitement after listening to the story with engrossed attention. oh of course it s nothing but humbug cried gania a little disturbed however. it s all humbug the young merchant was pleased to indulge in a little innocent recreation I have heard something of rogojin yes so have I replied the general. nastasia philipovna told us all about the earrings that very day. but now it is quite a different matter. you see the fellow really has a million of roubles and he is passionately in love. the whole story smells of passion and we all know what this class of gentry is capable of when infatuated. I am much afraid of some disagreeable scandal I am indeed you are afraid of the million I suppose said gania grinning and showing his teeth. and you are not I presume eh how did he strike you prince asked gania suddenly. did he seem to be a serious sort of a man or just a common rowdy fellow what was your own opinion about the matter while gania put this question a new idea suddenly flashed into his brain and blazed out impatiently in his eyes. the general who was really agitated and disturbed looked at the prince too but did not seem to expect much from his reply. I really don t quite know how to tell you replied the prince but it certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion and not perhaps quite healthy passion. he seemed to be still far from well. very likely he will be in bed again in a day or two especially if he lives fast. no do you think so said the general catching at the idea. yes I do think so yes but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at any moment. it may be this very evening remarked gania to the general with a smile. of course quite so. in that case it all depends upon what is going on in her brain at this moment. you know the kind of person she is at times. how what kind of person is she cried the general arrived at the limits of his patience. look here gania don t you go annoying her tonight. what you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you can. well what are you smiling at you must understand gania that I have no interest whatever in speaking like this. whichever way the question is settled it will be to my advantage. nothing will move totski from his resolution so I run no risk. if there is anything I desire you must know that it is your benefit only. can t you trust me you are a sensible fellow and I have been counting on you for in this matter that that yes that s the chief thing said gania helping the general out of his difficulties again and curling his lips in an envenomed smile which he did not attempt to conceal. he gazed with his fevered eyes straight into those of the general as though he were anxious that the latter might read his thoughts. the general grew purple with anger. yes of course it is the chief thing he cried looking sharply at gania. what a very curious man you are gania you actually seem to be glad to hear of this millionaire fellow s arrival just as though you wished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing. this is an affair in which you ought to act honestly with both sides and give due warning to avoid compromising others. but even now there is still time. do you understand me I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not if not say so and and welcome no one is trying to force you into the snare gavrila ardalionovitch if you see a snare in the matter at least. I do desire it murmured gania softly but firmly lowering his eyes and he relapsed into gloomy silence. the general was satisfied. he had excited himself and was evidently now regretting that he had gone so far. he turned to the prince and suddenly the disagreeable thought of the latter s presence struck him and the certainty that he must have heard every word of the conversation. but he felt at ease in another moment it only needed one glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear. oh cried the general catching sight of the prince s specimen of caligraphy which the latter had now handed him for inspection. why this is simply beautiful look at that gania there s real talent there on a sheet of thick writing paper the prince had written in medieval characters the legend the gentle abbot pafnute signed this. there explained the prince with great delight and animation there that s the abbot s real signature from a manuscript of the fourteenth century. all these old abbots and bishops used to write most beautifully with such taste and so much care and diligence. have you no copy of pogodin general if you had one I could show you another type. stop a bit here you have the large round writing common in france during the eighteenth century. some of the letters are shaped quite differently from those now in use. it was the writing current then and employed by public writers generally. I copied this from one of them and you can see how good it is. look at the well rounded a and d. I have tried to translate the french character into the russian letters a difficult thing to do but I think I have succeeded fairly. here is a fine sentence written in a good original hand zeal triumphs over all. that is the script of the russian war office. that is how official documents addressed to important personages should be written. the letters are round the type black and the style somewhat remarkable. a stylist would not allow these ornaments or attempts at flourishes just look at these unfinished tails but it has distinction and really depicts the soul of the writer. he would like to give play to his imagination and follow the inspiration of his genius but a soldier is only at ease in the guard room and the pen stops half way a slave to discipline. how delightful the first time I met an example of this handwriting I was positively astonished and where do you think I chanced to find it in switzerland of all places now that is an ordinary english hand. it can hardly be improved it is so refined and exquisite almost perfection. this is an example of another kind a mixture of styles. the copy was given me by a french commercial traveller. it is founded on the english but the downstrokes are a little blacker and more marked. notice that the oval has some slight modification it is more rounded. this writing allows for flourishes now a flourish is a dangerous thing its use requires such taste but if successful what a distinction it gives to the whole it results in an incomparable type one to fall in love with dear me how you have gone into all the refinements and details of the question why my dear fellow you are not a caligraphist you are an artist eh gania wonderful said gania. and he knows it too he added with a sarcastic smile. you may smile but there s a career in this said the general. you don t know what a great personage I shall show this to prince. why you can command a situation at thirty five roubles per month to start with. however it s half past twelve he concluded looking at his watch so to business prince for I must be setting to work and shall not see you again today. sit down a minute. I have told you that I cannot receive you myself very often but I should like to be of some assistance to you some small assistance of a kind that would give you satisfaction. I shall find you a place in one of the state departments an easy place but you will require to be accurate. now as to your plans in the house or rather in the family of gania here my young friend whom I hope you will know better his mother and sister have prepared two or three rooms for lodgers and let them to highly recommended young fellows with board and attendance. I am sure nina alexandrovna will take you in on my recommendation. there you will be comfortable and well taken care of for I do not think prince that you are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of fate in a town like petersburg. nina alexandrovna gania s mother and varvara alexandrovna are ladies for whom I have the highest possible esteem and respect. nina alexandrovna is the wife of general ardalion alexandrovitch my old brother in arms with whom I regret to say on account of certain circumstances I am no longer acquainted. I give you all this information prince in order to make it clear to you that I am personally recommending you to this family and that in so doing I am more or less taking upon myself to answer for you. the terms are most reasonable and I trust that your salary will very shortly prove amply sufficient for your expenditure. of course pocket money is a necessity if only a little do not be angry prince if I strongly recommend you to avoid carrying money in your pocket. but as your purse is quite empty at the present moment you must allow me to press these twenty five roubles upon your acceptance as something to begin with. of course we will settle this little matter another time and if you are the upright honest man you look I anticipate very little trouble between us on that score. taking so much interest in you as you may perceive I do I am not without my object and you shall know it in good time. you see I am perfectly candid with you. I hope gania you have nothing to say against the prince s taking up his abode in your house oh on the contrary my mother will be very glad said gania courteously and kindly. I think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet is it not that fellow ferd ferd ferdishenko. yes I don t like that ferdishenko. I can t understand why nastasia philipovna encourages him so. is he really her cousin as he says oh dear no it s all a joke. no more cousin than I am. well what do you think of the arrangement prince thank you general you have behaved very kindly to me all the more so since I did not ask you to help me. I don t say that out of pride. I certainly did not know where to lay my head tonight. rogojin asked me to come to his house of course but rogojin no no my good fellow. I should strongly recommend you paternally or if you prefer it as a friend to forget all about rogojin and in fact to stick to the family into which you are about to enter. thank you began the prince and since you are so very kind there is just one matter which I you must really excuse me interrupted the general but I positively haven t another moment now. I shall just tell elizabetha prokofievna about you and if she wishes to receive you at once as I shall advise her I strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the first opportunity for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in many ways. if she cannot receive you now you must be content to wait till another time. meanwhile you gania just look over these accounts will you we mustn t forget to finish off that matter the general left the room and the prince never succeeded in broaching the business which he had on hand though he had endeavoured to do so four times. gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. the latter accepted the offer but did not talk being unwilling to disturb gania s work. he commenced to examine the study and its contents. but gania hardly so much as glanced at the papers lying before him he was absent and thoughtful and his smile and general appearance struck the prince still more disagreeably now that the two were left alone together. suddenly gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over nastasia philipovna s portrait gazing at it. do you admire that sort of woman prince he asked looking intently at him. he seemed to have some special object in the question. it s a wonderful face said the prince and I feel sure that her destiny is not by any means an ordinary uneventful one. her face is smiling enough but she must have suffered terribly hasn t she her eyes show it those two bones there the little points under her eyes just where the cheek begins. it s a proud face too terribly proud and I i can t say whether she is good and kind or not. oh if she be but good that would make all well and would you marry a woman like that now continued gania never taking his excited eyes off the prince s face. I cannot marry at all said the latter. I am an invalid. would rogojin marry her do you think why not certainly he would I should think. he would marry her tomorrow marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week hardly had the prince uttered the last word when gania gave such a fearful shudder that the prince almost cried out. what s the matter said he seizing gania s hand. your highness his excellency begs your presence in her excellency s apartments announced the footman appearing at the door. the prince immediately followed the man out of the room. iv. all three of the miss epanchins were fine healthy girls well grown with good shoulders and busts and strong almost masculine hands and of course with all the above attributes they enjoyed capital appetites of which they were not in the least ashamed. elizabetha prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a little too candid in this matter but in spite of their outward deference to their mother these three young women in solemn conclave had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had been in the habit of according to her and mrs. general epanchin had judged it better to say nothing about it though of course she was well aware of the fact. it is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of reason and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient but having a respectful and well disciplined husband under her thumb at all times she found it possible as a rule to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon his head and therefore the harmony of the family was kept duly balanced and things went as smoothly as family matters can. mrs. epanchin had a fair appetite herself and generally took her share of the capital mid day lunch which was always served for the girls and which was nearly as good as a dinner. the young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal at ten o clock while still in bed. this was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. at half past twelve the table was laid in the small dining room and occasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering if he had time. besides tea and coffee cheese honey butter pan cakes of various kinds the lady of the house loved these best cutlets and so on there was generally strong beef soup and other substantial delicacies. on the particular morning on which our story has opened the family had assembled in the dining room and were waiting the general s appearance the latter having promised to come this day. if he had been one moment late he would have been sent for at once but he turned up punctually. as he came forward to wish his wife good morning and kiss her hands as his custom was he observed something in her look which boded ill. he thought he knew the reason and had expected it but still he was not altogether comfortable. his daughters advanced to kiss him too and though they did not look exactly angry there was something strange in their expression as well. the general was owing to certain circumstances a little inclined to be too suspicious at home and needlessly nervous but as an experienced father and husband he judged it better to take measures at once to protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air. however I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my narrative too much if I diverge for a moment at this point in order to explain the mutual relations between general epanchin s family and others acting a part in this history at the time when we take up the thread of their destiny. I have already stated that the general though he was a man of lowly origin and of poor education was for all that an experienced and talented husband and father. among other things he considered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial altar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes for their happiness as is the custom among parents of many grown up daughters. he even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this question though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish because unnatural but the general s arguments were conclusive and founded upon obvious facts. the general considered that the girls taste and good sense should be allowed to develop and mature deliberately and that the parents duty should merely be to keep watch in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made but that the selection once effected both father and mother were bound from that moment to enter heart and soul into the cause and to see that the matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily reached. besides this it was clear that the epanchins position gained each year with geometrical accuracy both as to financial solidity and social weight and therefore the longer the girls waited the better was their chance of making a brilliant match. but again amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded one more equally significant rose up to confront the family and this was that the eldest daughter alexandra had imperceptibly arrived at her twenty fifth birthday. almost at the same moment afanasy ivanovitch totski a man of immense wealth high connections and good standing announced his intention of marrying. afanasy ivanovitch was a gentleman of fifty five years of age artistically gifted and of most refined tastes. he wished to marry well and moreover he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty. now since totski had of late been upon terms of great cordiality with epanchin which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were so to speak partners in several financial enterprises it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated. might he suggest for instance such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the general s daughters evidently the quiet pleasant current of the family life of the epanchins was about to undergo a change. the undoubted beauty of the family par excellence was the youngest aglaya as aforesaid. but totski himself though an egotist of the extremest type realized that he had no chance there aglaya was clearly not for such as he. perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or less exaggerated aglaya s chances of happiness. in their opinion the latter s destiny was not merely to be very happy she was to live in a heaven on earth. aglaya s husband was to be a compendium of all the virtues and of all success not to speak of fabulous wealth. the two elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them if need be for aglaya s sake her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented. the general and his wife were aware of this agreement and therefore when totski suggested himself for one of the sisters the parents made no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the offer since totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. the general valued the proposal very highly. he knew life and realized what such an offer was worth. the answer of the sisters to the communication was if not conclusive at least consoling and hopeful. it made known that the eldest alexandra would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal. alexandra was a good natured girl though she had a will of her own. she was intelligent and kind hearted and if she were to marry totski she would make him a good wife. she did not care for a brilliant marriage she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life of any man decidedly pretty if not absolutely handsome. what better could totski wish so the matter crept slowly forward. the general and totski had agreed to avoid any hasty and irrevocable step. alexandra s parents had not even begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject when suddenly as it were a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the proceedings. mrs. epanchin began to show signs of discontent and that was a serious matter. a certain circumstance had crept in a disagreeable and troublesome factor which threatened to overturn the whole business. this circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. close to an estate of totski s in one of the central provinces of russia there lived at that time a poor gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest description. this gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent ill fortune his name was barashkoff and as regards family and descent he was vastly superior to totski but his estate was mortgaged to the last acre. one day when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor the chief peasant of his village followed him shortly after with the news that his house had been burnt down and that his wife had perished with it but his children were safe. even barashkoff inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was could not stand this last stroke. he went mad and died shortly after in the town hospital. his estate was sold for the creditors and the little girls two of them of seven and eight years of age respectively were adopted by totski who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness of his heart. they were brought up together with the children of his german bailiff. very soon however there was only one of them left nastasia philipovna for the other little one died of whooping cough. totski who was living abroad at this time very soon forgot all about the child but five years after returning to russia it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there and arrived at his bailiff s house he was not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve sweet and intelligent and bright and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality as to which last totski was an undoubted authority. he only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion but he had time to make his arrangements. great changes took place in the child s education a good governess was engaged a swiss lady of experience and culture. for four years this lady resided in the house with little nastia and then the education was considered complete. the governess took her departure and another lady came down to fetch nastia by totski s instructions. the child was now transported to another of totski s estates in a distant part of the country. here she found a delightful little house just built and prepared for her reception with great care and taste and here she took up her abode together with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home. in the house there were two experienced maids musical instruments of all sorts a charming young lady s library pictures paint boxes a lap dog and everything to make life agreeable. within a fortnight totski himself arrived and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer staying two and three months at a time. so passed four years peacefully and happily in charming surroundings. at the end of that time and about four months after totski s last visit he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion a report reached nastasia philipovna that he was about to be married in st. petersburg to a rich eminent and lovely woman. the report was only partially true the marriage project being only in an embryo condition but a great change now came over nastasia philipovna. she suddenly displayed unusual decision of character and without wasting time in thought she left her country home and came up to st. petersburg straight to totski s house all alone. the latter amazed at her conduct began to express his displeasure but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice style and everything else with this young lady the good old times were gone. an entirely new and different woman sat before him between whom and the girl he had left in the country last july there seemed nothing in common. in the first place this new woman understood a good deal more than was usual for young people of her age so much indeed that totski could not help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. surely not from her young lady s library it even embraced legal matters and the world in general to a considerable extent. her character was absolutely changed. no more of the girlish alternations of timidity and petulance the adorable naivete the reveries the tears the playfulness... it was an entirely new and hitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him and informed him to his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any kind except loathing and contempt contempt which had followed closely upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first acquaintance with him. this new woman gave him further to understand that though it was absolutely the same to her whom he married yet she had decided to prevent this marriage for no particular reason but that she chose to do so and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it was quite her turn to laugh a little now such were her words very likely she did not give her real reason for this eccentric conduct but at all events that was all the explanation she deigned to offer. meanwhile totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas would permit. his meditations lasted a fortnight however and at the end of that time his resolution was taken. the fact was totski was at that time a man of fifty years of age his position was solid and respectable his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe foundations he loved himself his personal comforts and his position better than all the world as every respectable gentleman should at the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed totski that he now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the ordinary rules of traditional behaviour and who would not only threaten mischief but would undoubtedly carry it out and stop for no one. there was evidently he concluded something at work here some storm of the mind some paroxysm of romantic anger goodness knows against whom or what some insatiable contempt in a word something altogether absurd and impossible but at the same time most dangerous to be met with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up. for a man of totski s wealth and standing it would of course have been the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at once from all annoyance while it was obviously impossible for nastasia philipovna to harm him in any way either legally or by stirring up a scandal for in case of the latter danger he could so easily remove her to a sphere of safety. however these arguments would only hold good in case of nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency. she was much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct by some extraordinary eccentricity. here the sound judgment of totski stood him in good stead. he realized that nastasia philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing by legal means to injure him and that her flashing eyes betrayed some entirely different intention. nastasia philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself and even of perpetrating something which would send her to siberia for the mere pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a sense of loathing and contempt. he had sufficient insight to understand that she valued nothing in the world herself least of all and he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects. for instance if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the altar or publicly insulted he would undoubtedly have been frightened but not so much at the idea of being murdered or wounded or insulted as at the thought that if such things were to happen he would be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of society. he knew well that nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound him and how and therefore as the marriage was still only in embryo totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. his decision was strengthened by the fact that nastasia philipovna had curiously altered of late. it would be difficult to conceive how different she was physically at the present time to the girl of a few years ago. she was pretty then... but now ... totski laughed angrily when he thought how short sighted he had been. in days gone by he remembered how he had looked at her beautiful eyes how even then he had marvelled at their dark mysterious depths and at their wondering gaze which seemed to seek an answer to some unknown riddle. her complexion also had altered. she was now exceedingly pale but curiously this change only made her more beautiful. like most men of the world totski had rather despised such a cheaply bought conquest but of late years he had begun to think differently about it. it had struck him as long ago as last spring that he ought to be finding a good match for nastasia for instance some respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office in another part of the country. how maliciously nastasia laughed at the idea of such a thing now however it appeared to totski that he might make use of her in another way and he determined to establish her in st. petersburg surrounding her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command. in this way he might gain glory in certain circles. five years of this petersburg life went by and of course during that time a great deal happened. totski s position was very uncomfortable having funked once he could not totally regain his ease. he was afraid he did not know why but he was simply afraid of nastasia philipovna. for the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to marry him herself and that only her vanity prevented her telling him so. he thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal from his own side. but to his great and not entirely pleasurable amazement he discovered that this was by no means the case and that were he to offer himself he would be refused. he could not understand such a state of things and was obliged to conclude that it was pride the pride of an injured and imaginative woman which had gone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt and hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable splendour. to make matters worse she was quite impervious to mercenary considerations and could not be bribed in any way. finally totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be free. he tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart he invited princes hussars secretaries of embassies poets novelists even socialists to see her but not one of them all made the faintest impression upon nastasia. it was as though she had a pebble in place of a heart as though her feelings and affections were dried up and withered for ever. she lived almost entirely alone she read she studied she loved music. her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades a couple of actresses and the family of a poor schoolteacher. among these people she was much beloved. she received four or five friends sometimes of an evening. totski often came. lately too general epanchin had been enabled with great difficulty to introduce himself into her circle. gania made her acquaintance also and others were ferdishenko an ill bred and would be witty young clerk and ptitsin a money lender of modest and polished manners who had risen from poverty. in fact nastasia philipovna s beauty became a thing known to all the town but not a single man could boast of anything more than his own admiration for her and this reputation of hers and her wit and culture and grace all confirmed totski in the plan he had now prepared. and it was at this moment that general epanchin began to play so large and important a part in the story. when totski had approached the general with his request for friendly counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters he had made a full and candid confession. he had said that he intended to stop at no means to obtain his freedom even if nastasia were to promise to leave him entirely alone in future he would not he said believe and trust her words were not enough for him he must have solid guarantees of some sort. so he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect. having arrived at nastasia s house one day with epanchin totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of his position. he admitted that he was to blame for all but candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse for his original guilt towards herself because he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and ineradicable and that he had no power over himself in this respect but that he wished seriously to marry at last and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which he contemplated was in her hands in a word he confided his all to her generosity of heart. general epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father of a family he spoke sensibly and without wasting words over any attempt at sentimentality he merely recorded his full admission of her right to be the arbiter of totski s destiny at this moment. he then pointed out that the fate of his daughter and very likely of both his other daughters now hung upon her reply. to nastasia s question as to what they wished her to do totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her five years ago that he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married. he immediately added that such a suggestion from him would of course be absurd unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. he very well knew he said that a certain young gentleman of good family namely gavrila ardalionovitch ivolgin with whom she was acquainted and whom she received at her house had long loved her passionately and would give his life for some response from her. the young fellow had confessed this love of his to him totski and had also admitted it in the hearing of his benefactor general epanchin. lastly he could not help being of opinion that nastasia must be aware of gania s love for her and if he totski mistook not she had looked with some favour upon it being often lonely and rather tired of her present life. having remarked how difficult it was for him of all people to speak to her of these matters totski concluded by saying that he trusted nastasia philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of seventy five thousand roubles. he added that the sum would have been left her all the same in his will and that therefore she must not consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything but that there was no reason after all why a man should not be allowed to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience etc. etc. in fact all that would naturally be said under the circumstances. totski was very eloquent all through and in conclusion just touched on the fact that not a soul in the world not even general epanchin had ever heard a word about the above seventy five thousand roubles and that this was the first time he had ever given expression to his intentions in respect to them. nastasia philipovna s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the friends considerably. not only was there no trace of her former irony of her old hatred and enmity and of that dreadful laughter the very recollection of which sent a cold chill down totski s back to this very day but she seemed charmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously with him for once in a way. she confessed that she had long wished to have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice but that pride had hitherto prevented her now however that the ice was broken nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity. first with a sad smile and then with a twinkle of merriment in her eyes she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now quite out of the question. she said that she had long since changed her views of things and recognized that facts must be taken into consideration in spite of the feelings of the heart. what was done was done and ended and she could not understand why totski should still feel alarmed. she next turned to general epanchin and observed most courteously that she had long since known of his daughters and that she had heard none but good report that she had learned to think of them with deep and sincere respect. the idea alone that she could in any way serve them would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness. it was true that she was lonely in her present life totski had judged her thoughts aright. she longed to rise if not to love at least to family life and new hopes and objects but as to gavrila ardalionovitch she could not as yet say much. she thought it must be the case that he loved her she felt that she too might learn to love him if she could be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself but he was very young and it was a difficult question to decide. what she specially liked about him was that he worked and supported his family by his toil. she had heard that he was proud and ambitious she had heard much that was interesting of his mother and sister she had heard of them from mr. ptitsin and would much like to make their acquaintance but another question would they like to receive her into their house at all events though she did not reject the idea of this marriage she desired not to be hurried. as for the seventy five thousand roubles mr. totski need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the matter she quite understood the value of money and would of course accept the gift. she thanked him for his delicacy however but saw no reason why gavrila ardalionovitch should not know about it. she would not marry the latter she said until she felt persuaded that neither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any sort of concealed suspicions as to herself. she did not intend to ask forgiveness for anything in the past which fact she desired to be known. she did not consider herself to blame for anything that had happened in former years and she thought that gavrila ardalionovitch should be informed as to the relations which had existed between herself and totski during the last five years. if she accepted this money it was not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young girl which had not been in any degree her own fault but merely as compensation for her ruined life. she became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and confessions that general epanchin was highly gratified and considered the matter satisfactorily arranged once for all. but the once bitten totski was twice shy and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers. however the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted to bring about their object namely gania s attractiveness for nastasia philipovna stood out more and more prominently the pourparlers had commenced and gradually even totski began to believe in the possibility of success. before long nastasia and gania had talked the matter over. very little was said her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of discussing such a question. but she recognized his love on the understanding that she bound herself to nothing whatever and that she reserved the right to say no up to the very hour of the marriage ceremony. gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last moment. it soon became clear to gania after scenes of wrath and quarrellings at the domestic hearth that his family were seriously opposed to the match and that nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident. she said nothing about it though he daily expected her to do so. there were several rumours afloat before long which upset totski s equanimity a good deal but we will not now stop to describe them merely mentioning an instance or two. one was that nastasia had entered into close and secret relations with the epanchin girls a most unlikely rumour another was that nastasia had long satisfied herself of the fact that gania was merely marrying her for money and that his nature was gloomy and greedy impatient and selfish to an extraordinary degree and that although he had been keen enough in his desire to achieve a conquest before yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his passion for their own purposes it was clear enough that he had begun to consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare. in his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway and although he had at last given his consent to marry the woman as he said under the stress of circumstances yet he promised himself that he would take it out of her after marriage. nastasia seemed to totski to have divined all this and to be preparing something on her own account which frightened him to such an extent that he did not dare communicate his views even to the general. but at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again acting in fact as weak men do act in such circumstances. however both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when one day nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on the evening of her birthday which anniversary was due in a very short time. a strange rumour began to circulate meanwhile no less than that the respectable and highly respected general epanchin was himself so fascinated by nastasia philipovna that his feeling for her amounted almost to passion. what he thought to gain by gania s marriage to the girl it was difficult to imagine. possibly he counted on gania s complaisance for totski had long suspected that there existed some secret understanding between the general and his secretary. at all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for nastasia s birthday and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. the day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation. mrs. epanchin long accustomed to her husband s infidelities had heard of the pearls and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest. the general remarked her suspicions and felt that a grand explanation must shortly take place which fact alarmed him much. this is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch on the morning upon which we took up this narrative with the rest of his family. before the prince s arrival he had made up his mind to plead business and cut the meal which simply meant running away. he was particularly anxious that this one day should be passed especially the evening without unpleasantness between himself and his family and just at the right moment the prince turned up as though heaven had sent him on purpose said the general to himself as he left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom. v. mrs. general epanchin was a proud woman by nature. what must her feelings have been when she heard that prince muishkin the last of his and her line had arrived in beggar s guise a wretched idiot a recipient of charity all of which details the general gave out for greater effect he was anxious to steal her interest at the first swoop so as to distract her thoughts from other matters nearer home. mrs. epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight and staring before her without speaking in moments of excitement. she was a fine woman of the same age as her husband with a slightly hooked nose a high narrow forehead thick hair turning a little grey and a sallow complexion. her eyes were grey and wore a very curious expression at times. she believed them to be most effective a belief that nothing could alter. what receive him now at once asked mrs. epanchin gazing vaguely at her husband as he stood fidgeting before her. oh dear me I assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with him the general explained hastily. he is quite a child not to say a pathetic looking creature. he has fits of some sort and has just arrived from switzerland straight from the station dressed like a german and without a farthing in his pocket. I gave him twenty five roubles to go on with and am going to find him some easy place in one of the government offices. I should like you to ply him well with the victuals my dears for I should think he must be very hungry. you astonish me said the lady gazing as before. fits and hungry too what sort of fits oh they don t come on frequently besides he s a regular child though he seems to be fairly educated. I should like you if possible my dears the general added making slowly for the door to put him through his paces a bit and see what he is good for. I think you should be kind to him it is a good deed you know however just as you like of course but he is a sort of relation remember and I thought it might interest you to see the young fellow seeing that this is so. oh of course mamma if we needn t stand on ceremony with him we must give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey especially as he has not the least idea where to go to said alexandra the eldest of the girls. besides he s quite a child we can entertain him with a little hide and seek in case of need said adelaida. hide and seek what do you mean inquired mrs. epanchin. oh do stop pretending mamma cried aglaya in vexation. send him up father mother allows. the general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be shown in. only on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch then said mrs. epanchin and let fedor or mavra stand behind him while he eats. is he quiet when he has these fits he doesn t show violence does he on the contrary he seems to be very well brought up. his manners are excellent but here he is himself. here you are prince let me introduce you the last of the muishkins a relative of your own my dear or at least of the same name. receive him kindly please. they ll bring in lunch directly prince you must stop and have some but you must excuse me. I m in a hurry I must be off we all know where you must be off to said mrs. epanchin in a meaning voice. yes yes I must hurry away I m late look here dears let him write you something in your albums you ve no idea what a wonderful caligraphist he is wonderful talent he has just written out abbot pafnute signed this for me. well au revoir stop a minute where are you off to who is this abbot cried mrs. epanchin to her retreating husband in a tone of excited annoyance. yes my dear it was an old abbot of that name I must be off to see the count he s waiting for me I m late good bye au revoir prince and the general bolted at full speed. oh yes I know what count you re going to see remarked his wife in a cutting manner as she turned her angry eyes on the prince. now then what s all this about what abbot who s pafnute she added brusquely. mamma said alexandra shocked at her rudeness. aglaya stamped her foot. nonsense let me alone said the angry mother. now then prince sit down here no nearer come nearer the light I want to have a good look at you. so now then who is this abbot abbot pafnute said our friend seriously and with deference. pafnute yes. and who was he mrs. epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely and when the prince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said. the abbot pafnute lived in the fourteenth century began the prince he was in charge of one of the monasteries on the volga about where our present kostroma government lies. he went to oreol and helped in the great matters then going on in the religious world he signed an edict there and I have seen a print of his signature it struck me so I copied it. when the general asked me in his study to write something for him to show my handwriting I wrote the abbot pafnute signed this in the exact handwriting of the abbot. the general liked it very much and that s why he recalled it just now. aglaya make a note of pafnute or we shall forget him. h m and where is this signature I think it was left on the general s table. let it be sent for at once oh I ll write you a new one in half a minute said the prince if you like of course mamma said alexandra. but let s have lunch now we are all hungry yes come along prince said the mother are you very hungry yes I must say that I am pretty hungry thanks very much. h m I like to see that you know your manners and you are by no means such a person as the general thought fit to describe you. come along you sit here opposite to me she continued I wish to be able to see your face. alexandra adelaida look after the prince he doesn t seem so very ill does he I don t think he requires a napkin under his chin after all are you accustomed to having one on prince formerly when I was seven years old or so. I believe I wore one but now I usually hold my napkin on my knee when I eat. of course of course and about your fits fits asked the prince slightly surprised. I very seldom have fits nowadays. I don t know how it may be here though they say the climate may be bad for me. he talks very well you know said mrs. epanchin who still continued to nod at each word the prince spoke. I really did not expect it at all in fact I suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the general s part as usual. eat away prince and tell me where you were born and where you were brought up. I wish to know all about you you interest me very much the prince expressed his thanks once more and eating heartily the while recommenced the narrative of his life in switzerland all of which we have heard before. mrs. epanchin became more and more pleased with her guest the girls too listened with considerable attention. in talking over the question of relationship it turned out that the prince was very well up in the matter and knew his pedigree off by heart. it was found that scarcely any connection existed between himself and mrs. epanchin but the talk and the opportunity of conversing about her family tree gratified the latter exceedingly and she rose from the table in great good humour. let s all go to my boudoir she said and they shall bring some coffee in there. that s the room where we all assemble and busy ourselves as we like best she explained. alexandra my eldest here plays the piano or reads or sews adelaida paints landscapes and portraits but never finishes any and aglaya sits and does nothing. I don t work too much either. here we are now sit down prince near the fire and talk to us. I want to hear you relate something. I wish to make sure of you first and then tell my old friend princess bielokonski about you. I wish you to know all the good people and to interest them. now then begin mamma it s rather a strange order that said adelaida who was fussing among her paints and paint brushes at the easel. aglaya and alexandra had settled themselves with folded hands on a sofa evidently meaning to be listeners. the prince felt that the general attention was concentrated upon himself. I should refuse to say a word if I were ordered to tell a story like that observed aglaya. why what s there strange about it he has a tongue. why shouldn t he tell us something I want to judge whether he is a good story teller anything you like prince how you liked switzerland what was your first impression anything. you ll see he ll begin directly and tell us all about it beautifully. the impression was forcible the prince began. there you see girls said the impatient lady he has begun you see. well then let him talk mamma said alexandra. this prince is a great humbug and by no means an idiot she whispered to aglaya. oh I saw that at once replied the latter. I don t think it at all nice of him to play a part. what does he wish to gain by it I wonder my first impression was a very strong one repeated the prince. when they took me away from russia I remember I passed through many german towns and looked out of the windows but did not trouble so much as to ask questions about them. this was after a long series of fits. I always used to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series and lost my memory almost entirely and though I was not altogether without reason at such times yet I had no logical power of thought. this would continue for three or four days and then I would recover myself again. I remember my melancholy was intolerable I felt inclined to cry I sat and wondered and wondered uncomfortably the consciousness that everything was strange weighed terribly upon me I could understand that it was all foreign and strange. I recollect I awoke from this state for the first time at basle one evening the bray of a donkey aroused me a donkey in the town market. I saw the donkey and was extremely pleased with it and from that moment my head seemed to clear. a donkey how strange yet it is not strange. anyone of us might fall in love with a donkey it happened in mythological times said madame epanchin looking wrathfully at her daughters who had begun to laugh. go on prince. since that evening I have been specially fond of donkeys. I began to ask questions about them for I had never seen one before and I at once came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of animals strong willing patient cheap and thanks to this donkey I began to like the whole country I was travelling through and my melancholy passed away. all this is very strange and interesting said mrs. epanchin. now let s leave the donkey and go on to other matters. what are you laughing at aglaya and you too adelaida the prince told us his experiences very cleverly he saw the donkey himself and what have you ever seen you have never been abroad. I have seen a donkey though mamma said aglaya. and I ve heard one said adelaida. all three of the girls laughed out loud and the prince laughed with them. well it s too bad of you said mamma. you must forgive them prince they are good girls. I am very fond of them though I often have to be scolding them they are all as silly and mad as march hares. oh why shouldn t they laugh said the prince. I shouldn t have let the chance go by in their place I know. but I stick up for the donkey all the same he s a patient good natured fellow. are you a patient man prince I ask out of curiosity said mrs. epanchin. all laughed again. oh that wretched donkey again I see cried the lady. I assure you prince I was not guilty of the least insinuation oh I assure you I take your word for it. and the prince continued laughing merrily. I must say it s very nice of you to laugh. I see you really are a kind hearted fellow said mrs. epanchin. I m not always kind though. I am kind myself and always kind too if you please she retorted unexpectedly and that is my chief fault for one ought not to be always kind. I am often angry with these girls and their father but the worst of it is I am always kindest when I am cross. I was very angry just before you came and aglaya there read me a lesson thanks aglaya dear come and kiss me there that s enough she added as aglaya came forward and kissed her lips and then her hand. now then go on prince. perhaps you can think of something more exciting than about the donkey eh I must say again I can t understand how you can expect anyone to tell you stories straight away so said adelaida. I know I never could yes but the prince can because he is clever cleverer than you are by ten or twenty times if you like. there that s so prince and seriously let s drop the donkey now what else did you see abroad besides the donkey yes but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly all the same said alexandra. I have always been most interested to hear how people go mad and get well again and that sort of thing. especially when it happens suddenly. quite so quite so cried mrs. epanchin delighted. I see you can be sensible now and then alexandra. you were speaking of switzerland prince yes. we came to lucerne and I was taken out in a boat. I felt how lovely it was but the loveliness weighed upon me somehow or other and made me feel melancholy. why asked alexandra. I don t know I always feel like that when I look at the beauties of nature for the first time but then I was ill at that time of course oh but I should like to see it said adelaida and I don t know when we shall ever go abroad. I ve been two years looking out for a good subject for a picture. I ve done all I know. the north and south I know by heart as our poet observes. do help me to a subject prince. oh but I know nothing about painting. it seems to me one only has to look and paint what one sees. but I don t know how to see nonsense what rubbish you talk the mother struck in. not know how to see open your eyes and look if you can t see here you won t see abroad either. tell us what you saw yourself prince yes that s better said adelaida the prince learned to see abroad. oh I hardly know you see I only went to restore my health. I don t know whether I learned to see exactly. I was very happy however nearly all the time. happy you can be happy cried aglaya. then how can you say you did not learn to see I should think you could teach us to see oh do teach us laughed adelaida. oh I can t do that said the prince laughing too. I lived almost all the while in one little swiss village what can I teach you at first I was only just not absolutely dull then my health began to improve then every day became dearer and more precious to me and the longer I stayed the dearer became the time to me so much so that I could not help observing it but why this was so it would be difficult to say. so that you didn t care to go away anywhere else well at first I did I was restless I didn t know however I should manage to support life you know there are such moments especially in solitude. there was a waterfall near us such a lovely thin streak of water like a thread but white and moving. it fell from a great height but it looked quite low and it was half a mile away though it did not seem fifty paces. I loved to listen to it at night but it was then that I became so restless. sometimes I went and climbed the mountain and stood there in the midst of the tall pines all alone in the terrible silence with our little village in the distance and the sky so blue and the sun so bright and an old ruined castle on the mountain side far away. I used to watch the line where earth and sky met and longed to go and seek there the key of all mysteries thinking that I might find there a new life perhaps some great city where life should be grander and richer and then it struck me that life may be grand enough even in a prison. I read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual when I was twelve years old said aglaya. all this is pure philosophy said adelaida. you are a philosopher prince and have come here to instruct us in your views. perhaps you are right said the prince smiling. I think I am a philosopher perhaps and who knows perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with your philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we know who is rich and yet does nothing but try how little she can spend. she talks of nothing but money all day. your great philosophical idea of a grand life in a prison and your four happy years in that swiss village are like this rather said aglaya. as to life in a prison of course there may be two opinions said the prince. I once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a prison I heard it from the man himself. he was one of the persons under treatment with my professor he had fits and attacks of melancholy then he would weep and once he tried to commit suicide. his life in prison was sad enough his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating but I think I had better tell you of another man I met last year. there was a very strange feature in this case strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. this man had once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others and had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime. twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment substituted but the interval between the two sentences twenty minutes or at least a quarter of an hour had been passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. I was very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and felt. he remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary distinctness and declared that he would never forget a single iota of the experience. about twenty paces from the scaffold where he had stood to hear the sentence were three posts fixed in the ground to which to fasten the criminals of whom there were several . the first three criminals were taken to the posts dressed in long white tunics with white caps drawn over their faces so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them. then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. my friend was the eighth on the list and therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up. a priest went about among them with a cross and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live. he said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable period an enormous wealth of time he seemed to be living in these minutes so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last moment so that he made several arrangements dividing up the time into portions one for saying farewell to his companions two minutes for that then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all about himself and another minute for a last look around. he remembered having divided his time like this quite well. while saying good bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday question and being much interested in the answer. then having bade farewell he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself he knew beforehand what he was going to think about. he wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible that here was he a living thinking man and that in three minutes he would be nobody or if somebody or something then what and where he thought he would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes. a little way off there stood a church and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. he remembered staring stubbornly at this spire and at the rays of light sparkling from it. he could not tear his eyes from these rays of light he got the idea that these rays were his new nature and that in three minutes he would become one of them amalgamated somehow with them. the repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately and the uncertainty were dreadful he said but worst of all was the idea what should I do if I were not to die now what if I were to return to life again what an eternity of days and all mine how I should grudge and count up every minute of it so as to waste not a single instant he said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done with it. the prince paused and all waited expecting him to go on again and finish the story. is that all asked aglaya. all yes said the prince emerging from a momentary reverie. and why did you tell us this oh I happened to recall it that s all it fitted into the conversation you probably wish to deduce prince said alexandra that moments of time cannot be reckoned by money value and that sometimes five minutes are worth priceless treasures. all this is very praiseworthy but may I ask about this friend of yours who told you the terrible experience of his life he was reprieved you say in other words they did restore to him that eternity of days. what did he do with these riches of time did he keep careful account of his minutes oh no he didn t I asked him myself. he said that he had not lived a bit as he had intended and had wasted many and many a minute. very well then there s an experiment and the thing is proved one cannot live and count each moment say what you like but one cannot . that is true said the prince I have thought so myself. and yet why shouldn t one do it you think then that you could live more wisely than other people said aglaya. I have had that idea. and you have it still yes I have it still the prince replied. he had contemplated aglaya until now with a pleasant though rather timid smile but as the last words fell from his lips he began to laugh and looked at her merrily. you are not very modest said she. but how brave you are said he. you are laughing and I that man s tale impressed me so much that I dreamt of it afterwards yes I dreamt of those five minutes... he looked at his listeners again with that same serious searching expression. you are not angry with me he asked suddenly and with a kind of nervous hurry although he looked them straight in the face. why should we be angry they cried. only because I seem to be giving you a lecture all the time at this they laughed heartily. please don t be angry with me continued the prince. I know very well that I have seen less of life than other people and have less knowledge of it. I must appear to speak strangely sometimes... he said the last words nervously. you say you have been happy and that proves you have lived not less but more than other people. why make all these excuses interrupted aglaya in a mocking tone of voice. besides you need not mind about lecturing us you have nothing to boast of. with your quietism one could live happily for a hundred years at least. one might show you the execution of a felon or show you one s little finger. you could draw a moral from either and be quite satisfied. that sort of existence is easy enough. I can t understand why you always fly into a temper said mrs. epanchin who had been listening to the conversation and examining the faces of the speakers in turn. I do not understand what you mean. what has your little finger to do with it the prince talks well though he is not amusing. he began all right but now he seems sad. never mind mamma prince I wish you had seen an execution said aglaya. I should like to ask you a question about that if you had. I have seen an execution said the prince. you have cried aglaya. I might have guessed it. that s a fitting crown to the rest of the story. if you have seen an execution how can you say you lived happily all the while but is there capital punishment where you were asked adelaida. I saw it at lyons. schneider took us there and as soon as we arrived we came in for that. well and did you like it very much was it very edifying and instructive asked aglaya. no I didn t like it at all and was ill after seeing it but I confess I stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight. I could not tear them away. I too should have been unable to tear my eyes away said aglaya. they do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there. the women who do go are condemned for it afterwards in the newspapers. that is by contending that it is not a sight for women they admit that it is a sight for men. I congratulate them on the deduction. I suppose you quite agree with them prince tell us about the execution put in adelaida. I would much rather not just now said the prince a little disturbed and frowning slightly. you don t seem to want to tell us said aglaya with a mocking air. no the thing is I was telling all about the execution a little while ago and whom did you tell about it the man servant while I was waiting to see the general. our man servant exclaimed several voices at once. yes the one who waits in the entrance hall a greyish red faced man the prince is clearly a democrat remarked aglaya. well if you could tell aleksey about it surely you can tell us too. I do so want to hear about it repeated adelaida. just now I confess began the prince with more animation when you asked me for a subject for a picture I confess I had serious thoughts of giving you one. I thought of asking you to draw the face of a criminal one minute before the fall of the guillotine while the wretched man is still standing on the scaffold preparatory to placing his neck on the block. what his face only his face asked adelaida. that would be a strange subject indeed. and what sort of a picture would that make oh why not the prince insisted with some warmth. when I was in basle I saw a picture very much in that style I should like to tell you about it I will some time or other it struck me very forcibly. oh you shall tell us about the basle picture another time now we must have all about the execution said adelaida. tell us about that face as it appeared to your imagination how should it be drawn just the face alone do you mean it was just a minute before the execution began the prince readily carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything else in a moment just at the instant when he stepped off the ladder on to the scaffold. he happened to look in my direction I saw his eyes and understood all at once but how am I to describe it I do so wish you or somebody else could draw it you if possible. I thought at the time what a picture it would make. you must imagine all that went before of course all all. he had lived in the prison for some time and had not expected that the execution would take place for at least a week yet he had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time but it so happened that his papers had been got ready quickly. at five o clock in the morning he was asleep it was october and at five in the morning it was cold and dark. the governor of the prison comes in on tip toe and touches the sleeping man s shoulder gently. he starts up. what is it he says. the execution is fixed for ten o clock. he was only just awake and would not believe at first but began to argue that his papers would not be out for a week and so on. when he was wide awake and realized the truth he became very silent and argued no more so they say but after a bit he said it comes very hard on one so suddenly and then he was silent again and said nothing. the three or four hours went by of course in necessary preparations the priest breakfast coffee meat and some wine they gave him doesn t it seem ridiculous and yet I believe these people give them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart and believe that they are doing a good action. then he is dressed and then begins the procession through the town to the scaffold. I think he too must feel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along. probably he thought on the way oh I have a long long time yet. three streets of life yet when we ve passed this street there ll be that other one and then that one where the baker s shop is on the right and when shall we get there it s ages ages around him are crowds shouting yelling ten thousand faces twenty thousand eyes. all this has to be endured and especially the thought here are ten thousand men and not one of them is going to be executed and yet I am to die. well all that is preparatory. at the scaffold there is a ladder and just there he burst into tears and this was a strong man and a terribly wicked one they say there was a priest with him the whole time talking even in the cart as they drove along he talked and talked. probably the other heard nothing he would begin to listen now and then and at the third word or so he had forgotten all about it. at last he began to mount the steps his legs were tied so that he had to take very small steps. the priest who seemed to be a wise man had stopped talking now and only held the cross for the wretched fellow to kiss. at the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough but when he set foot on the scaffold at the top his face suddenly became the colour of paper positively like white notepaper. his legs must have become suddenly feeble and helpless and he felt a choking in his throat you know the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear when one does not lose one s wits but is absolutely powerless to move if some dreadful thing were suddenly to happen if a house were just about to fall on one don t you know how one would long to sit down and shut one s eyes and wait and wait well when this terrible feeling came over him the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips without a word a little silver cross it was and he kept on pressing it to the man s lips every second. and whenever the cross touched his lips the eyes would open for a moment and the legs moved once and he kissed the cross greedily hurriedly just as though he were anxious to catch hold of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards though he could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the time. and so up to the very block. how strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment on the contrary the brain is especially active and works incessantly probably hard hard hard like an engine at full pressure. I imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his head all unfinished ones and strange funny thoughts very likely like this for instance that man is looking at me and he has a wart on his forehead and the executioner has burst one of his buttons and the lowest one is all rusty and meanwhile he notices and remembers everything. there is one point that cannot be forgotten round which everything else dances and turns about and because of this point he cannot faint and this lasts until the very final quarter of a second when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens and waits and knows that s the point he knows that he is just now about to die and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head. if I lay there I should certainly listen for that grating sound and hear it too there would probably be but the tenth part of an instant left to hear it in but one would certainly hear it. and imagine some people declare that when the head flies off it is conscious of having flown off just imagine what a thing to realize fancy if consciousness were to last for even five seconds draw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in clearly. the criminal must be just stepping on to it his face as white as note paper. the priest is holding the cross to his blue lips and the criminal kisses it and knows and sees and understands everything. the cross and the head there s your picture the priest and the executioner with his two assistants and a few heads and eyes below. those might come in as subordinate accessories a sort of mist. there s a picture for you. the prince paused and looked around. certainly that isn t much like quietism murmured alexandra half to herself. now tell us about your love affairs said adelaida after a moment s pause. the prince gazed at her in amazement. you know adelaida continued you owe us a description of the basle picture but first I wish to hear how you fell in love. don t deny the fact for you did of course. besides you stop philosophizing when you are telling about anything. why are you ashamed of your stories the moment after you have told them asked aglaya suddenly. how silly you are said mrs. epanchin looking indignantly towards the last speaker. yes that wasn t a clever remark said alexandra. don t listen to her prince said mrs. epanchin she says that sort of thing out of mischief. don t think anything of their nonsense it means nothing. they love to chaff but they like you. I can see it in their faces I know their faces. I know their faces too said the prince with a peculiar stress on the words. how so asked adelaida with curiosity. what do you know about our faces exclaimed the other two in chorus. but the prince was silent and serious. all awaited his reply. I ll tell you afterwards he said quietly. ah you want to arouse our curiosity said aglaya. and how terribly solemn you are about it very well interrupted adelaida then if you can read faces so well you must have been in love. come now I ve guessed let s have the secret I have not been in love said the prince as quietly and seriously as before. I have been happy in another way. how how well I ll tell you said the prince apparently in a deep reverie. vi. here you all are began the prince settling yourselves down to listen to me with so much curiosity that if I do not satisfy you you will probably be angry with me. no no I m only joking he added hastily with a smile. well then they were all children there and I was always among children and only with children. they were the children of the village in which I lived and they went to the school there all of them. I did not teach them oh no there was a master for that one jules thibaut. I may have taught them some things but I was among them just as an outsider and I passed all four years of my life there among them. I wished for nothing better I used to tell them everything and hid nothing from them. their fathers and relations were very angry with me because the children could do nothing without me at last and used to throng after me at all times. the schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in the end I had many enemies and all because of the children. even schneider reproached me. what were they afraid of one can tell a child everything anything. I have often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so little. they should not conceal so much from them. how well even little children understand that their parents conceal things from them because they consider them too young to understand children are capable of giving advice in the most important matters. how can one deceive these dear little birds when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly I call them birds because there is nothing in the world better than birds however most of the people were angry with me about one and the same thing but thibaut simply was jealous of me. at first he had wagged his head and wondered how it was that the children understood what I told them so well and could not learn from him and he laughed like anything when I replied that neither he nor I could teach them very much but that they might teach us a good deal. how he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me living among children as he did is what I cannot understand. children soothe and heal the wounded heart. I remember there was one poor fellow at our professor s who was being treated for madness and you have no idea what those children did for him eventually. I don t think he was mad but only terribly unhappy. but I ll tell you all about him another day. now I must get on with this story. the children did not love me at first I was such a sickly awkward kind of a fellow then and I know I am ugly. besides I was a foreigner. the children used to laugh at me at first and they even went so far as to throw stones at me when they saw me kiss marie. I only kissed her once in my life no no don t laugh the prince hastened to suppress the smiles of his audience at this point. it was not a matter of love at all if only you knew what a miserable creature she was you would have pitied her just as I did. she belonged to our village. her mother was an old old woman and they used to sell string and thread and soap and tobacco out of the window of their little house and lived on the pittance they gained by this trade. the old woman was ill and very old and could hardly move. marie was her daughter a girl of twenty weak and thin and consumptive but still she did heavy work at the houses around day by day. well one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed her and carried her off and a week later he deserted her. she came home dirty draggled and shoeless she had walked for a whole week without shoes she had slept in the fields and caught a terrible cold her feet were swollen and sore and her hands torn and scratched all over. she never had been pretty even before but her eyes were quiet innocent kind eyes. she was very quiet always and I remember once when she had suddenly begun singing at her work everyone said marie tried to sing today and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after. she had been treated kindly in the place before but when she came back now ill and shunned and miserable not one of them all had the slightest sympathy for her. cruel people oh what hazy understandings they have on such matters her mother was the first to show the way. she received her wrathfully unkindly and with contempt. you have disgraced me she said. she was the first to cast her into ignominy but when they all heard that marie had returned to the village they ran out to see her and crowded into the little cottage old men children women girls such a hurrying stamping greedy crowd. marie was lying on the floor at the old woman s feet hungry torn draggled crying miserable. when everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her dishevelled hair and lay cowering on the floor. everyone looked at her as though she were a piece of dirt off the road. the old men scolded and condemned and the young ones laughed at her. the women condemned her too and looked at her contemptuously just as though she were some loathsome insect. her mother allowed all this to go on and nodded her head and encouraged them. the old woman was very ill at that time and knew she was dying she really did die a couple of months later and though she felt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter to the very day of her death. she would not even speak to her. she made her sleep on straw in a shed and hardly gave her food enough to support life. marie was very gentle to her mother and nursed her and did everything for her but the old woman accepted all her services without a word and never showed her the slightest kindness. marie bore all this and I could see when I got to know her that she thought it quite right and fitting considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures. when the old woman took to her bed finally the other old women in the village sat with her by turns as the custom is there and then marie was quite driven out of the house. they gave her no food at all and she could not get any work in the village none would employ her. the men seemed to consider her no longer a woman they said such dreadful things to her. sometimes on sundays if they were drunk enough they used to throw her a penny or two into the mud and marie would silently pick up the money. she had began to spit blood at that time. at last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of appearing in the village any longer. the children used to pelt her with mud so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd but the cowherd would not have her. then she took to helping him without leave and he saw how valuable her assistance was to him and did not drive her away again on the contrary he occasionally gave her the remnants of his dinner bread and cheese. he considered that he was being very kind. when the mother died the village parson was not ashamed to hold marie up to public derision and shame. marie was standing at the coffin s head in all her rags crying. a crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry. the parson a young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher began his sermon and pointed to marie. there he said there is the cause of the death of this venerable woman which was a lie because she had been ill for at least two years there she stands before you and dares not lift her eyes from the ground because she knows that the finger of god is upon her. look at her tatters and rags the badge of those who lose their virtue. who is she her daughter and so on to the end. and just fancy this infamy pleased them all of them nearly. only the children had altered for then they were all on my side and had learned to love marie. this is how it was I had wished to do something for marie I longed to give her some money but I never had a farthing while I was there. but I had a little diamond pin and this I sold to a travelling pedlar he gave me eight francs for it it was worth at least forty. I long sought to meet marie alone and at last I did meet her on the hillside beyond the village. I gave her the eight francs and asked her to take care of the money because I could get no more and then I kissed her and said that she was not to suppose I kissed her with any evil motives or because I was in love with her for that I did so solely out of pity for her and because from the first I had not accounted her as guilty so much as unfortunate. I longed to console and encourage her somehow and to assure her that she was not the low base thing which she and others strove to make out but I don t think she understood me. she stood before me dreadfully ashamed of herself and with downcast eyes and when I had finished she kissed my hand. I would have kissed hers but she drew it away. just at this moment the whole troop of children saw us. I found out afterwards that they had long kept a watch upon me. they all began whistling and clapping their hands and laughing at us. marie ran away at once and when I tried to talk to them they threw stones at me. all the village heard of it the same day and marie s position became worse than ever. the children would not let her pass now in the streets but annoyed her and threw dirt at her more than before. they used to run after her she racing away with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping and they pelting her and shouting abuse at her. once I had to interfere by force and after that I took to speaking to them every day and whenever I could. occasionally they stopped and listened but they teased marie all the same. I told them how unhappy marie was and after a while they stopped their abuse of her and let her go by silently. little by little we got into the way of conversing together the children and i. I concealed nothing from them I told them all. they listened very attentively and soon began to be sorry for marie. at last some of them took to saying good morning to her kindly when they met her. it is the custom there to salute anyone you meet with good morning whether acquainted or not. I can imagine how astonished marie was at these first greetings from the children. once two little girls got hold of some food and took it to her and came back and told me. they said she had burst into tears and that they loved her very much now. very soon after that they all became fond of marie and at the same time they began to develop the greatest affection for myself. they often came to me and begged me to tell them stories. I think I must have told stories well for they did so love to hear them. at last I took to reading up interesting things on purpose to pass them on to the little ones and this went on for all the rest of my time there three years. later when everyone even schneider was angry with me for hiding nothing from the children I pointed out how foolish it was for they always knew things only they learnt them in a way that soiled their minds but not so from me. one has only to remember one s own childhood to admit the truth of this. but nobody was convinced... it was two weeks before her mother died that I had kissed marie and when the clergyman preached that sermon the children were all on my side. when I told them what a shame it was of the parson to talk as he had done and explained my reason they were so angry that some of them went and broke his windows with stones. of course I stopped them for that was not right but all the village heard of it and how I caught it for spoiling the children everyone discovered now that the little ones had taken to being fond of marie and their parents were terribly alarmed but marie was so happy. the children were forbidden to meet her but they used to run out of the village to the herd and take her food and things and sometimes just ran off there and kissed her and said je vous aime marie and then trotted back again. they imagined that I was in love with marie and this was the only point on which I did not undeceive them for they got such enjoyment out of it. and what delicacy and tenderness they showed in the evening I used to walk to the waterfall. there was a spot there which was quite closed in and hidden from view by large trees and to this spot the children used to come to me. they could not bear that their dear leon should love a poor girl without shoes to her feet and dressed all in rags and tatters. so would you believe it they actually clubbed together somehow and bought her shoes and stockings and some linen and even a dress I can t understand how they managed it but they did it all together. when I asked them about it they only laughed and shouted and the little girls clapped their hands and kissed me. I sometimes went to see marie secretly too. she had become very ill and could hardly walk. she still went with the herd but could not help the herdsman any longer. she used to sit on a stone near and wait there almost motionless all day till the herd went home. her consumption was so advanced and she was so weak that she used to sit with closed eyes breathing heavily. her face was as thin as a skeleton s and sweat used to stand on her white brow in large drops. I always found her sitting just like that. I used to come up quietly to look at her but marie would hear me open her eyes and tremble violently as she kissed my hands. I did not take my hand away because it made her happy to have it and so she would sit and cry quietly. sometimes she tried to speak but it was very difficult to understand her. she was almost like a madwoman with excitement and ecstasy whenever I came. occasionally the children came with me when they did so they would stand some way off and keep guard over us so as to tell me if anybody came near. this was a great pleasure to them. when we left her marie used to relapse at once into her old condition and sit with closed eyes and motionless limbs. one day she could not go out at all and remained at home all alone in the empty hut but the children very soon became aware of the fact and nearly all of them visited her that day as she lay alone and helpless in her miserable bed. for two days the children looked after her and then when the village people got to know that marie was really dying some of the old women came and took it in turns to sit by her and look after her a bit. I think they began to be a little sorry for her in the village at last at all events they did not interfere with the children any more on her account. marie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole while she coughed dreadfully. the old women would not let the children stay in the room but they all collected outside the window each morning if only for a moment and shouted bon jour notre bonne marie and marie no sooner caught sight of or heard them and she became quite animated at once and in spite of the old women would try to sit up and nod her head and smile at them and thank them. the little ones used to bring her nice things and sweets to eat but she could hardly touch anything. thanks to them I assure you the girl died almost perfectly happy. she almost forgot her misery and seemed to accept their love as a sort of symbol of pardon for her offence though she never ceased to consider herself a dreadful sinner. they used to flutter at her window just like little birds calling out nous t aimons marie she died very soon I had thought she would live much longer. the day before her death I went to see her for the last time just before sunset. I think she recognized me for she pressed my hand. next morning they came and told me that marie was dead. the children could not be restrained now they went and covered her coffin with flowers and put a wreath of lovely blossoms on her head. the pastor did not throw any more shameful words at the poor dead woman but there were very few people at the funeral. however when it came to carrying the coffin all the children rushed up to carry it themselves. of course they could not do it alone but they insisted on helping and walked alongside and behind crying. they have planted roses all round her grave and every year they look after the flowers and make marie s resting place as beautiful as they can. I was in ill odour after all this with the parents of the children and especially with the parson and schoolmaster. schneider was obliged to promise that I should not meet them and talk to them but we conversed from a distance by signs and they used to write me sweet little notes. afterwards I came closer than ever to those little souls but even then it was very dear to me to have them so fond of me. schneider said that I did the children great harm by my pernicious system what nonsense that was and what did he mean by my system he said afterwards that he believed I was a child myself just before I came away. you have the form and face of an adult he said but as regards soul and character and perhaps even intelligence you are a child in the completest sense of the word and always will be if you live to be sixty. I laughed very much for of course that is nonsense. but it is a fact that I do not care to be among grown up people and much prefer the society of children. however kind people may be to me I never feel quite at home with them and am always glad to get back to my little companions. now my companions have always been children not because I was a child myself once but because young things attract me. on one of the first days of my stay in switzerland I was strolling about alone and miserable when I came upon the children rushing noisily out of school with their slates and bags and books their games their laughter and shouts and my soul went out to them. I stopped and laughed happily as I watched their little feet moving so quickly. girls and boys laughing and crying for as they went home many of them found time to fight and make peace to weep and play. I forgot my troubles in looking at them. and then all those three years I tried to understand why men should be for ever tormenting themselves. I lived the life of a child there and thought I should never leave the little village indeed I was far from thinking that I should ever return to russia. but at last I recognized the fact that schneider could not keep me any longer. and then something so important happened that schneider himself urged me to depart. I am going to see now if can get good advice about it. perhaps my lot in life will be changed but that is not the principal thing. the principal thing is the entire change that has already come over me. I left many things behind me too many. they have gone. on the journey I said to myself I am going into the world of men. I don t know much perhaps but a new life has begun for me. I made up my mind to be honest and steadfast in accomplishing my task. perhaps I shall meet with troubles and many disappointments but I have made up my mind to be polite and sincere to everyone more cannot be asked of me. people may consider me a child if they like. I am often called an idiot and at one time I certainly was so ill that I was nearly as bad as an idiot but I am not an idiot now. how can I possibly be so when I know myself that I am considered one when I received a letter from those dear little souls while passing through berlin I only then realized how much I loved them. it was very very painful getting that first little letter. how melancholy they had been when they saw me off for a month before they had been talking of my departure and sorrowing over it and at the waterfall of an evening when we parted for the night they would hug me so tight and kiss me so warmly far more so than before. and every now and then they would turn up one by one when I was alone just to give me a kiss and a hug to show their love for me. the whole flock went with me to the station which was about a mile from the village and every now and then one of them would stop to throw his arms round me and all the little girls had tears in their voices though they tried hard not to cry. as the train steamed out of the station I saw them all standing on the platform waving to me and crying hurrah till they were lost in the distance. I assure you when I came in here just now and saw your kind faces I can read faces well my heart felt light for the first time since that moment of parting. I think I must be one of those who are born to be in luck for one does not often meet with people whom one feels he can love from the first sight of their faces and yet no sooner do I step out of the railway carriage than I happen upon you I know it is more or less a shamefaced thing to speak of one s feelings before others and yet here am I talking like this to you and am not a bit ashamed or shy. I am an unsociable sort of fellow and shall very likely not come to see you again for some time but don t think the worse of me for that. it is not that I do not value your society and you must never suppose that I have taken offence at anything. you asked me about your faces and what I could read in them I will tell you with the greatest pleasure. you adelaida ivanovna have a very happy face it is the most sympathetic of the three. not to speak of your natural beauty one can look at your face and say to one s self she has the face of a kind sister. you are simple and merry but you can see into another s heart very quickly. that s what I read in your face. you too alexandra ivanovna have a very lovely face but I think you may have some secret sorrow. your heart is undoubtedly a kind good one but you are not merry. there is a certain suspicion of shadow in your face like in that of holbein s madonna in dresden. so much for your face. have I guessed right as for your face lizabetha prokofievna I not only think but am perfectly sure that you are an absolute child in all in all mind both good and bad and in spite of your years. don t be angry with me for saying so you know what my feelings for children are. and do not suppose that I am so candid out of pure simplicity of soul. oh dear no it is by no means the case perhaps I have my own very profound object in view. vii. when the prince ceased speaking all were gazing merrily at him even aglaya but lizabetha prokofievna looked the jolliest of all. well she cried we have put him through his paces with a vengeance my dears you imagined I believe that you were about to patronize this young gentleman like some poor prot g picked up somewhere and taken under your magnificent protection. what fools we were and what a specially big fool is your father well done prince I assure you the general actually asked me to put you through your paces and examine you. as to what you said about my face you are absolutely correct in your judgment. I am a child and know it. I knew it long before you said so you have expressed my own thoughts. I think your nature and mine must be extremely alike and I am very glad of it. we are like two drops of water only you are a man and I a woman and I ve not been to switzerland and that is all the difference between us. don t be in a hurry mother the prince says that he has some motive behind his simplicity cried aglaya. yes yes so he does laughed the others. oh don t you begin bantering him said mamma. he is probably a good deal cleverer than all three of you girls put together. we shall see. only you haven t told us anything about aglaya yet prince and aglaya and I are both waiting to hear. I cannot say anything at present. I ll tell you afterwards. why her face is clear enough isn t it oh yes of course. you are very beautiful aglaya ivanovna so beautiful that one is afraid to look at you. is that all what about her character persisted mrs. epanchin. it is difficult to judge when such beauty is concerned. I have not prepared my judgment. beauty is a riddle. that means that you have set aglaya a riddle said adelaida. guess it aglaya but she s pretty prince isn t she most wonderfully so said the latter warmly gazing at aglaya with admiration. almost as lovely as nastasia philipovna but quite a different type. all present exchanged looks of surprise. as lovely as who said mrs. epanchin. as nastasia philipovna where have you seen nastasia philipovna what nastasia philipovna gavrila ardalionovitch showed the general her portrait just now. how so did he bring the portrait for my husband only to show it. nastasia philipovna gave it to gavrila ardalionovitch today and the latter brought it here to show to the general. I must see it cried mrs. epanchin. where is the portrait if she gave it to him he must have it and he is still in the study. he never leaves before four o clock on wednesdays. send for gavrila ardalionovitch at once. no I don t long to see him so much. look here dear prince be so kind will you just step to the study and fetch this portrait say we want to look at it. please do this for me will you he is a nice fellow but a little too simple said adelaida as the prince left the room. he is indeed said alexandra almost laughably so at times. neither one nor the other seemed to give expression to her full thoughts. he got out of it very neatly about our faces though said aglaya. he flattered us all round even mamma. nonsense cried the latter. he did not flatter me. it was I who found his appreciation flattering. I think you are a great deal more foolish than he is. he is simple of course but also very knowing. just like myself. how stupid of me to speak of the portrait thought the prince as he entered the study with a feeling of guilt at his heart and yet perhaps I was right after all. he had an idea unformed as yet but a strange idea. gavrila ardalionovitch was still sitting in the study buried in a mass of papers. he looked as though he did not take his salary from the public company whose servant he was for a sinecure. he grew very wroth and confused when the prince asked for the portrait and explained how it came about that he had spoken of it. oh curse it all he said what on earth must you go blabbing for you know nothing about the thing and yet idiot he added muttering the last word to himself in irrepressible rage. I am very sorry I was not thinking at the time. I merely said that aglaya was almost as beautiful as nastasia philipovna. gania asked for further details and the prince once more repeated the conversation. gania looked at him with ironical contempt the while. nastasia philipovna he began and there paused he was clearly much agitated and annoyed. the prince reminded him of the portrait. listen prince said gania as though an idea had just struck him I wish to ask you a great favour and yet I really don t know he paused again he was trying to make up his mind to something and was turning the matter over. the prince waited quietly. once more gania fixed him with intent and questioning eyes. prince he began again they are rather angry with me in there owing to a circumstance which I need not explain so that I do not care to go in at present without an invitation. I particularly wish to speak to aglaya but I have written a few words in case I shall not have the chance of seeing her here the prince observed a small note in his hand and I do not know how to get my communication to her. don t you think you could undertake to give it to her at once but only to her mind and so that no one else should see you give it it isn t much of a secret but still well will you do it I don t quite like it replied the prince. oh but it is absolutely necessary for me gania entreated. believe me if it were not so I would not ask you how else am I to get it to her it is most important dreadfully important gania was evidently much alarmed at the idea that the prince would not consent to take his note and he looked at him now with an expression of absolute entreaty. well I will take it then. but mind nobody is to see cried the delighted gania and of course I may rely on your word of honour eh I won t show it to anyone said the prince. the letter is not sealed continued gania and paused in confusion. oh I won t read it said the prince quite simply. he took up the portrait and went out of the room. gania left alone clutched his head with his hands. one word from her he said one word from her and I may yet be free. he could not settle himself to his papers again for agitation and excitement but began walking up and down the room from corner to corner. the prince walked along musing. he did not like his commission and disliked the idea of gania sending a note to aglaya at all but when he was two rooms distant from the drawing room where they all were he stopped as though recalling something went to the window nearer the light and began to examine the portrait in his hand. he longed to solve the mystery of something in the face of nastasia philipovna something which had struck him as he looked at the portrait for the first time the impression had not left him. it was partly the fact of her marvellous beauty that struck him and partly something else. there was a suggestion of immense pride and disdain in the face almost of hatred and at the same time something confiding and very full of simplicity. the contrast aroused a deep sympathy in his heart as he looked at the lovely face. the blinding loveliness of it was almost intolerable this pale thin face with its flaming eyes it was a strange beauty. the prince gazed at it for a minute or two then glanced around him and hurriedly raised the portrait to his lips. when a minute after he reached the drawing room door his face was quite composed. but just as he reached the door he met aglaya coming out alone. gavrila ardalionovitch begged me to give you this he said handing her the note. aglaya stopped took the letter and gazed strangely into the prince s eyes. there was no confusion in her face a little surprise perhaps but that was all. by her look she seemed merely to challenge the prince to an explanation as to how he and gania happened to be connected in this matter. but her expression was perfectly cool and quiet and even condescending. so they stood for a moment or two confronting one another. at length a faint smile passed over her face and she passed by him without a word. mrs. epanchin examined the portrait of nastasia philipovna for some little while holding it critically at arm s length. yes she is pretty she said at last even very pretty. I have seen her twice but only at a distance. so you admire this kind of beauty do you she asked the prince suddenly. yes I do this kind. do you mean especially this kind yes especially this kind. why there is much suffering in this face murmured the prince more as though talking to himself than answering the question. I think you are wandering a little prince mrs. epanchin decided after a lengthened survey of his face and she tossed the portrait on to the table haughtily. alexandra took it and adelaida came up and both the girls examined the photograph. just then aglaya entered the room. what a power cried adelaida suddenly as she earnestly examined the portrait over her sister s shoulder. whom what power asked her mother crossly. such beauty is real power said adelaida. with such beauty as that one might overthrow the world. she returned to her easel thoughtfully. aglaya merely glanced at the portrait frowned and put out her underlip then went and sat down on the sofa with folded hands. mrs. epanchin rang the bell. ask gavrila ardalionovitch to step this way said she to the man who answered. mamma cried alexandra significantly. I shall just say two words to him that s all said her mother silencing all objection by her manner she was evidently seriously put out. you see prince it is all secrets with us just now all secrets. it seems to be the etiquette of the house for some reason or other. stupid nonsense and in a matter which ought to be approached with all candour and open heartedness. there is a marriage being talked of and I don t like this marriage mamma what are you saying said alexandra again hurriedly. well what my dear girl as if you can possibly like it yourself the heart is the great thing and the rest is all rubbish though one must have sense as well. perhaps sense is really the great thing. don t smile like that aglaya. I don t contradict myself. a fool with a heart and no brains is just as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart. I am one and you are the other and therefore both of us suffer both of us are unhappy. why are you so unhappy mother asked adelaida who alone of all the company seemed to have preserved her good temper and spirits up to now. in the first place because of my carefully brought up daughters said mrs. epanchin cuttingly and as that is the best reason I can give you we need not bother about any other at present. enough of words now we shall see how both of you I don t count aglaya will manage your business and whether you most revered alexandra ivanovna will be happy with your fine mate. ah she added as gania suddenly entered the room here s another marrying subject. how do you do she continued in response to gania s bow but she did not invite him to sit down. you are going to be married married how what marriage murmured gania overwhelmed with confusion. are you about to take a wife I ask if you prefer that expression. no no I i no said gania bringing out his lie with a tell tale blush of shame. he glanced keenly at aglaya who was sitting some way off and dropped his eyes immediately. aglaya gazed coldly intently and composedly at him without taking her eyes off his face and watched his confusion. no you say no do you continued the pitiless mrs. general. very well I shall remember that you told me this wednesday morning in answer to my question that you are not going to be married. what day is it wednesday isn t it yes I think so said adelaida. you never know the day of the week what s the day of the month twenty seventh said gania. twenty seventh very well. good bye now you have a good deal to do I m sure and I must dress and go out. take your portrait. give my respects to your unfortunate mother nina alexandrovna. au revoir dear prince come in and see us often do and I shall tell old princess bielokonski about you. I shall go and see her on purpose. and listen my dear boy I feel sure that god has sent you to petersburg from switzerland on purpose for me. maybe you will have other things to do besides but you are sent chiefly for my sake I feel sure of it. god sent you to me au revoir alexandra come with me my dear. mrs. epanchin left the room. gania confused annoyed furious took up his portrait and turned to the prince with a nasty smile on his face. prince he said I am just going home. if you have not changed your mind as to living with us perhaps you would like to come with me. you don t know the address I believe wait a minute prince said aglaya suddenly rising from her seat do write something in my album first will you father says you are a most talented caligraphist I ll bring you my book in a minute. she left the room. well au revoir prince said adelaida I must be going too. she pressed the prince s hand warmly and gave him a friendly smile as she left the room. she did not so much as look at gania. this is your doing prince said gania turning on the latter so soon as the others were all out of the room. this is your doing sir you have been telling them that I am going to be married he said this in a hurried whisper his eyes flashing with rage and his face ablaze. you shameless tattler I assure you you are under a delusion said the prince calmly and politely. I did not even know that you were to be married. you heard me talking about it the general and me. you heard me say that everything was to be settled today at nastasia philipovna s and you went and blurted it out here. you lie if you deny it. who else could have told them devil take it sir who could have told them except yourself didn t the old woman as good as hint as much to me if she hinted to you who told her you must know best of course but I never said a word about it. did you give my note is there an answer interrupted gania impatiently. but at this moment aglaya came back and the prince had no time to reply. there prince said she there s my album. now choose a page and write me something will you there s a pen a new one do you mind a steel one I have heard that you caligraphists don t like steel pens. conversing with the prince aglaya did not even seem to notice that gania was in the room. but while the prince was getting his pen ready finding a page and making his preparations to write gania came up to the fireplace where aglaya was standing to the right of the prince and in trembling broken accents said almost in her ear one word just one word from you and I m saved. the prince turned sharply round and looked at both of them. gania s face was full of real despair he seemed to have said the words almost unconsciously and on the impulse of the moment. aglaya gazed at him for some seconds with precisely the same composure and calm astonishment as she had shown a little while before when the prince handed her the note and it appeared that this calm surprise and seemingly absolute incomprehension of what was said to her were more terribly overwhelming to gania than even the most plainly expressed disdain would have been. what shall I write asked the prince. I ll dictate to you said aglaya coming up to the table. now then are you ready write I never condescend to bargain now put your name and the date. let me see it. the prince handed her the album. capital how beautifully you have written it thanks so much. au revoir prince. wait a minute she added I want to give you something for a keepsake. come with me this way will you the prince followed her. arrived at the dining room she stopped. read this she said handing him gania s note. the prince took it from her hand but gazed at her in bewilderment. oh I know you haven t read it and that you could never be that man s accomplice. read it I wish you to read it. the letter had evidently been written in a hurry my fate is to be decided today it ran you know how. this day I must give my word irrevocably. I have no right to ask your help and I dare not allow myself to indulge in any hopes but once you said just one word and that word lighted up the night of my life and became the beacon of my days. say one more such word and save me from utter ruin. only tell me break off the whole thing and I will do so this very day. oh what can it cost you to say just this one word in doing so you will but be giving me a sign of your sympathy for me and of your pity only this only this nothing more nothing . I dare not indulge in any hope because I am unworthy of it. but if you say but this word I will take up my cross again with joy and return once more to my battle with poverty. I shall meet the storm and be glad of it I shall rise up with renewed strength. send me back then this one word of sympathy only sympathy I swear to you and oh do not be angry with the audacity of despair with the drowning man who has dared to make this last effort to save himself from perishing beneath the waters. g.l. this man assures me said aglaya scornfully when the prince had finished reading the letter that the words break off everything do not commit me to anything whatever and himself gives me a written guarantee to that effect in this letter. observe how ingenuously he underlines certain words and how crudely he glosses over his hidden thoughts. he must know that if he broke off everything first by himself and without telling me a word about it or having the slightest hope on my account that in that case I should perhaps be able to change my opinion of him and even accept his friendship. he must know that but his soul is such a wretched thing. he knows it and cannot make up his mind he knows it and yet asks for guarantees. he cannot bring himself to trust he wants me to give him hopes of myself before he lets go of his hundred thousand roubles. as to the former word which he declares lighted up the night of his life he is simply an impudent liar I merely pitied him once. but he is audacious and shameless. he immediately began to hope at that very moment. I saw it. he has tried to catch me ever since he is still fishing for me. well enough of this. take the letter and give it back to him as soon as you have left our house not before of course. and what shall I tell him by way of answer nothing of course that s the best answer. is it the case that you are going to live in his house yes your father kindly recommended me to him. then look out for him I warn you he won t forgive you easily for taking back the letter. aglaya pressed the prince s hand and left the room. her face was serious and frowning she did not even smile as she nodded good bye to him at the door. I ll just get my parcel and we ll go said the prince to gania as he re entered the drawing room. gania stamped his foot with impatience. his face looked dark and gloomy with rage. at last they left the house behind them the prince carrying his bundle. the answer quick the answer said gania the instant they were outside. what did she say did you give the letter the prince silently held out the note. gania was struck motionless with amazement. how what my letter he cried. he never delivered it I might have guessed it oh curse him of course she did not understand what I meant naturally why why why didn t you give her the note you excuse me I was able to deliver it almost immediately after receiving your commission and I gave it too just as you asked me to. it has come into my hands now because aglaya ivanovna has just returned it to me. how when as soon as I finished writing in her album for her and when she asked me to come out of the room with her you heard we went into the dining room and she gave me your letter to read and then told me to return it. to read cried gania almost at the top of his voice to read and you read it and again he stood like a log in the middle of the pavement so amazed that his mouth remained open after the last word had left it. yes I have just read it. and she gave it you to read herself herself yes herself and you may believe me when I tell you that I would not have read it for anything without her permission. gania was silent for a minute or two as though thinking out some problem. suddenly he cried it s impossible she cannot have given it to you to read you are lying. you read it yourself I am telling you the truth said the prince in his former composed tone of voice and believe me I am extremely sorry that the circumstance should have made such an unpleasant impression upon you but you wretched man at least she must have said something there must be some answer from her yes of course she did say something out with it then damn it out with it at once and gania stamped his foot twice on the pavement. as soon as I had finished reading it she told me that you were fishing for her that you wished to compromise her so far as to receive some hopes from her trusting to which hopes you might break with the prospect of receiving a hundred thousand roubles. she said that if you had done this without bargaining with her if you had broken with the money prospects without trying to force a guarantee out of her first she might have been your friend. that s all I think. oh no when I asked her what I was to say as I took the letter she replied that no answer is the best answer. I think that was it. forgive me if I do not use her exact expressions. I tell you the sense as I understood it myself. ungovernable rage and madness took entire possession of gania and his fury burst out without the least attempt at restraint. oh that s it is it he yelled. she throws my letters out of the window does she oh and she does not condescend to bargain while I do eh we shall see we shall see I shall pay her out for this. he twisted himself about with rage and grew paler and paler he shook his fist. so the pair walked along a few steps. gania did not stand on ceremony with the prince he behaved just as though he were alone in his room. he clearly counted the latter as a nonentity. but suddenly he seemed to have an idea and recollected himself. but how was it he asked how was it that you idiot that you are he added to himself were so very confidential a couple of hours after your first meeting with these people how was that eh up to this moment jealousy had not been one of his torments now it suddenly gnawed at his heart. that is a thing I cannot undertake to explain replied the prince. gania looked at him with angry contempt. oh I suppose the present she wished to make to you when she took you into the dining room was her confidence eh I suppose that was it I cannot explain it otherwise. but why why devil take it what did you do in there why did they fancy you look here can t you remember exactly what you said to them from the very beginning can t you remember oh we talked of a great many things. when first I went in we began to speak of switzerland. oh the devil take switzerland then about executions. executions yes at least about one. then I told the whole three years story of my life and the history of a poor peasant girl oh damn the peasant girl go on go on said gania impatiently. then how schneider told me about my childish nature and oh curse schneider and his dirty opinions go on. then I began to talk about faces at least about the expressions of faces and said that aglaya ivanovna was nearly as lovely as nastasia philipovna. it was then I blurted out about the portrait but you didn t repeat what you heard in the study you didn t repeat that eh no I tell you I did not . then how did they look here did aglaya show my letter to the old lady oh there I can give you my fullest assurance that she did not . I was there all the while she had no time to do it but perhaps you may not have observed it oh you damned idiot you he shouted quite beside himself with fury. you can t even describe what went on. gania having once descended to abuse and receiving no check very soon knew no bounds or limit to his licence as is often the way in such cases. his rage so blinded him that he had not even been able to detect that this idiot whom he was abusing to such an extent was very far from being slow of comprehension and had a way of taking in an impression and afterwards giving it out again which was very un idiotic indeed. but something a little unforeseen now occurred. I think I ought to tell you gavrila ardalionovitch said the prince suddenly that though I once was so ill that I really was little better than an idiot yet now I am almost recovered and that therefore it is not altogether pleasant to be called an idiot to my face. of course your anger is excusable considering the treatment you have just experienced but I must remind you that you have twice abused me rather rudely. I do not like this sort of thing and especially so at the first time of meeting a man and therefore as we happen to be at this moment standing at a crossroad don t you think we had better part you to the left homewards and I to the right here I have twenty five roubles and I shall easily find a lodging. gania was much confused and blushed for shame do forgive me prince he cried suddenly changing his abusive tone for one of great courtesy. for heaven s sake forgive me you see what a miserable plight I am in but you hardly know anything of the facts of the case as yet. if you did I am sure you would forgive me at least partially. of course it was inexcusable of me I know but oh dear me I really do not require such profuse apologies replied the prince hastily. I quite understand how unpleasant your position is and that is what made you abuse me. so come along to your house after all. I shall be delighted I am not going to let him go like this thought gania glancing angrily at the prince as they walked along. the fellow has sucked everything out of me and now he takes off his mask there s something more than appears here we shall see. it shall all be as clear as water by tonight everything but by this time they had reached gania s house. viii. the flat occupied by gania and his family was on the third floor of the house. it was reached by a clean light staircase and consisted of seven rooms a nice enough lodging and one would have thought a little too good for a clerk on two thousand roubles a year. but it was designed to accommodate a few lodgers on board terms and had been taken a few months since much to the disgust of gania at the urgent request of his mother and his sister varvara ardalionovna who longed to do something to increase the family income a little and fixed their hopes upon letting lodgings. gania frowned upon the idea. he thought it infra dig and did not quite like appearing in society afterwards that society in which he had been accustomed to pose up to now as a young man of rather brilliant prospects. all these concessions and rebuffs of fortune of late had wounded his spirit severely and his temper had become extremely irritable his wrath being generally quite out of proportion to the cause. but if he had made up his mind to put up with this sort of life for a while it was only on the plain understanding with his inner self that he would very soon change it all and have things as he chose again. yet the very means by which he hoped to make this change threatened to involve him in even greater difficulties than he had had before. the flat was divided by a passage which led straight out of the entrance hall. along one side of this corridor lay the three rooms which were designed for the accommodation of the highly recommended lodgers. besides these three rooms there was another small one at the end of the passage close to the kitchen which was allotted to general ivolgin the nominal master of the house who slept on a wide sofa and was obliged to pass into and out of his room through the kitchen and up or down the back stairs. colia gania s young brother a school boy of thirteen shared this room with his father. he too had to sleep on an old sofa a narrow uncomfortable thing with a torn rug over it his chief duty being to look after his father who needed to be watched more and more every day. the prince was given the middle room of the three the first being occupied by one ferdishenko while the third was empty. but gania first conducted the prince to the family apartments. these consisted of a salon which became the dining room when required a drawing room which was only a drawing room in the morning and became gania s study in the evening and his bedroom at night and lastly nina alexandrovna s and varvara s bedroom a small close chamber which they shared together. in a word the whole place was confined and a tight fit for the party. gania used to grind his teeth with rage over the state of affairs though he was anxious to be dutiful and polite to his mother. however it was very soon apparent to anyone coming into the house that gania was the tyrant of the family. nina alexandrovna and her daughter were both seated in the drawing room engaged in knitting and talking to a visitor ivan petrovitch ptitsin. the lady of the house appeared to be a woman of about fifty years of age thin faced and with black lines under the eyes. she looked ill and rather sad but her face was a pleasant one for all that and from the first word that fell from her lips any stranger would at once conclude that she was of a serious and particularly sincere nature. in spite of her sorrowful expression she gave the idea of possessing considerable firmness and decision. her dress was modest and simple to a degree dark and elderly in style but both her face and appearance gave evidence that she had seen better days. varvara was a girl of some twenty three summers of middle height thin but possessing a face which without being actually beautiful had the rare quality of charm and might fascinate even to the extent of passionate regard. she was very like her mother she even dressed like her which proved that she had no taste for smart clothes. the expression of her grey eyes was merry and gentle when it was not as lately too full of thought and anxiety. the same decision and firmness was to be observed in her face as in her mother s but her strength seemed to be more vigorous than that of nina alexandrovna. she was subject to outbursts of temper of which even her brother was a little afraid. the present visitor ptitsin was also afraid of her. this was a young fellow of something under thirty dressed plainly but neatly. his manners were good but rather ponderously so. his dark beard bore evidence to the fact that he was not in any government employ. he could speak well but preferred silence. on the whole he made a decidedly agreeable impression. he was clearly attracted by varvara and made no secret of his feelings. she trusted him in a friendly way but had not shown him any decided encouragement as yet which fact did not quell his ardour in the least. nina alexandrovna was very fond of him and had grown quite confidential with him of late. ptitsin as was well known was engaged in the business of lending out money on good security and at a good rate of interest. he was a great friend of gania s. after a formal introduction by gania who greeted his mother very shortly took no notice of his sister and immediately marched ptitsin out of the room nina alexandrovna addressed a few kind words to the prince and forthwith requested colia who had just appeared at the door to show him to the middle room. colia was a nice looking boy. his expression was simple and confiding and his manners were very polite and engaging. where s your luggage he asked as he led the prince away to his room. I had a bundle it s in the entrance hall. I ll bring it you directly. we only have a cook and one maid so I have to help as much as I can. varia looks after things generally and loses her temper over it. gania says you have only just arrived from switzerland yes. is it jolly there very. mountains yes. I ll go and get your bundle. here varvara joined them. the maid shall bring your bed linen directly. have you a portmanteau no a bundle your brother has just gone to the hall for it. there s nothing there except this said colia returning at this moment. where did you put it oh but that s all I have said the prince taking it. ah I thought perhaps ferdishenko had taken it. don t talk nonsense said varia severely. she seemed put out and was only just polite with the prince. oho laughed the boy you can be nicer than that to me you know I m not ptitsin you ought to be whipped colia you silly boy. if you want anything to the prince please apply to the servant. we dine at half past four. you can take your dinner with us or have it in your room just as you please. come along colia don t disturb the prince. at the door they met gania coming in. is father in he asked. colia whispered something in his ear and went out. just a couple of words prince if you ll excuse me. don t blab over there about what you may see here or in this house as to all that about aglaya and me you know. things are not altogether pleasant in this establishment devil take it all you ll see. at all events keep your tongue to yourself for today . I assure you I blabbed a great deal less than you seem to suppose said the prince with some annoyance. clearly the relations between gania and himself were by no means improving. oh well I caught it quite hot enough today thanks to you. however I forgive you. I think you might fairly remember that I was not in any way bound I had no reason to be silent about that portrait. you never asked me not to mention it. pfu what a wretched room this is dark and the window looking into the yard. your coming to our house is in no respect opportune. however it s not my affair. I don t keep the lodgings. ptitsin here looked in and beckoned to gania who hastily left the room in spite of the fact that he had evidently wished to say something more and had only made the remark about the room to gain time. the prince had hardly had time to wash and tidy himself a little when the door opened once more and another figure appeared. this was a gentleman of about thirty tall broad shouldered and red haired his face was red too and he possessed a pair of thick lips a wide nose small eyes rather bloodshot and with an ironical expression in them as though he were perpetually winking at someone. his whole appearance gave one the idea of impudence his dress was shabby. he opened the door just enough to let his head in. his head remained so placed for a few seconds while he quietly scrutinized the room the door then opened enough to admit his body but still he did not enter. he stood on the threshold and examined the prince carefully. at last he gave the door a final shove entered approached the prince took his hand and seated himself and the owner of the room on two chairs side by side. ferdishenko he said gazing intently and inquiringly into the prince s eyes. very well what next said the latter almost laughing in his face. a lodger here continued the other staring as before. do you wish to make acquaintance asked the prince. ah said the visitor passing his fingers through his hair and sighing. he then looked over to the other side of the room and around it. got any money he asked suddenly. not much. how much twenty five roubles. let s see it. the prince took his banknote out and showed it to ferdishenko. the latter unfolded it and looked at it then he turned it round and examined the other side then he held it up to the light. how strange that it should have browned so he said reflectively. these twenty five rouble notes brown in a most extraordinary way while other notes often grow paler. take it. the prince took his note. ferdishenko rose. I came here to warn you he said. in the first place don t lend me any money for I shall certainly ask you to. very well. shall you pay here yes I intend to. oh I don t intend to. thanks. I live here next door to you you noticed a room did you don t come to me very often I shall see you here quite often enough. have you seen the general no. nor heard him no of course not. well you ll both hear and see him soon he even tries to borrow money from me. avis au lecteur. good bye do you think a man can possibly live with a name like ferdishenko why not good bye. and so he departed. the prince found out afterwards that this gentleman made it his business to amaze people with his originality and wit but that it did not as a rule come off. he even produced a bad impression on some people which grieved him sorely but he did not change his ways for all that. as he went out of the prince s room he collided with yet another visitor coming in. ferdishenko took the opportunity of making several warning gestures to the prince from behind the new arrival s back and left the room in conscious pride. this next arrival was a tall red faced man of about fifty five with greyish hair and whiskers and large eyes which stood out of their sockets. his appearance would have been distinguished had it not been that he gave the idea of being rather dirty. he was dressed in an old coat and he smelled of vodka when he came near. his walk was effective and he clearly did his best to appear dignified and to impress people by his manner. this gentleman now approached the prince slowly and with a most courteous smile silently took his hand and held it in his own as he examined the prince s features as though searching for familiar traits therein. tis he tis he he said at last quietly but with much solemnity. as though he were alive once more. I heard the familiar name the dear familiar name and oh how it reminded me of the irrevocable past prince muishkin I believe exactly so. general ivolgin retired and unfortunate. may I ask your christian and generic names lef nicolaievitch. so so the son of my old I may say my childhood s friend nicolai petrovitch. my father s name was nicolai lvovitch. lvovitch repeated the general without the slightest haste and with perfect confidence just as though he had not committed himself the least in the world but merely made a little slip of the tongue. he sat down and taking the prince s hand drew him to a seat next to himself. I carried you in my arms as a baby he observed. really asked the prince. why it s twenty years since my father died. yes yes twenty years and three months. we were educated together I went straight into the army and he my father went into the army too. he was a sub lieutenant in the vasiliefsky regiment. no sir in the bielomirsky he changed into the latter shortly before his death. I was at his bedside when he died and gave him my blessing for eternity. your mother the general paused as though overcome with emotion. she died a few months later from a cold said the prince. oh not cold believe an old man not from a cold but from grief for her prince. oh your mother your mother heigh ho youth youth your father and I old friends as we were nearly murdered each other for her sake. the prince began to be a little incredulous. I was passionately in love with her when she was engaged engaged to my friend. the prince noticed the fact and was furious. he came and woke me at seven o clock one morning. I rise and dress in amazement silence on both sides. I understand it all. he takes a couple of pistols out of his pocket across a handkerchief without witnesses. why invite witnesses when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of minutes the pistols are loaded we stretch the handkerchief and stand opposite one another. we aim the pistols at each other s hearts. suddenly tears start to our eyes our hands shake we weep we embrace the battle is one of self sacrifice now the prince shouts she is yours I cry she is yours in a word in a word you ve come to live with us hey yes yes for a while I think stammered the prince. prince mother begs you to come to her said colia appearing at the door. the prince rose to go but the general once more laid his hand in a friendly manner on his shoulder and dragged him down on to the sofa. as the true friend of your father I wish to say a few words to you he began. I have suffered there was a catastrophe. I suffered without a trial I had no trial. nina alexandrovna my wife is an excellent woman so is my daughter varvara. we have to let lodgings because we are poor a dreadful unheard of come down for us for me who should have been a governor general but we are very glad to have you at all events. meanwhile there is a tragedy in the house. the prince looked inquiringly at the other. yes a marriage is being arranged a marriage between a questionable woman and a young fellow who might be a flunkey. they wish to bring this woman into the house where my wife and daughter reside but while I live and breathe she shall never enter my doors. I shall lie at the threshold and she shall trample me underfoot if she does. I hardly talk to gania now and avoid him as much as I can. I warn you of this beforehand but you cannot fail to observe it. but you are the son of my old friend and I hope prince be so kind as to come to me for a moment in the drawing room said nina alexandrovna herself appearing at the door. imagine my dear cried the general it turns out that I have nursed the prince on my knee in the old days. his wife looked searchingly at him and glanced at the prince but said nothing. the prince rose and followed her but hardly had they reached the drawing room and nina alexandrovna had begun to talk hurriedly when in came the general. she immediately relapsed into silence. the master of the house may have observed this but at all events he did not take any notice of it he was in high good humour. a son of my old friend dear he cried surely you must remember prince nicolai lvovitch you saw him at at tver. I don t remember any nicolai lvovitch. was that your father she inquired of the prince. yes but he died at elizabethgrad not at tver said the prince rather timidly. so pavlicheff told me. no tver insisted the general he removed just before his death. you were very small and cannot remember and pavlicheff though an excellent fellow may have made a mistake. you knew pavlicheff then oh yes a wonderful fellow but I was present myself. I gave him my blessing. my father was just about to be tried when he died said the prince although I never knew of what he was accused. he died in hospital. oh it was the kolpakoff business and of course he would have been acquitted. yes do you know that for a fact asked the prince whose curiosity was aroused by the general s words. I should think so indeed cried the latter. the court martial came to no decision. it was a mysterious an impossible business one might say captain larionoff commander of the company had died his command was handed over to the prince for the moment. very well. this soldier kolpakoff stole some leather from one of his comrades intending to sell it and spent the money on drink. well the prince you understand that what follows took place in the presence of the sergeant major and a corporal the prince rated kolpakoff soundly and threatened to have him flogged. well kolpakoff went back to the barracks lay down on a camp bedstead and in a quarter of an hour was dead you quite understand it was as I said a strange almost impossible affair. in due course kolpakoff was buried the prince wrote his report the deceased s name was removed from the roll. all as it should be is it not but exactly three months later at the inspection of the brigade the man kolpakoff was found in the third company of the second battalion of infantry novozemlianski division just as if nothing had happened what said the prince much astonished. it did not occur it s a mistake said nina alexandrovna quickly looking at the prince rather anxiously. mon mari se trompe she added speaking in french. my dear se trompe is easily said. do you remember any case at all like it everybody was at their wits end. I should be the first to say qu on se trompe but unfortunately I was an eye witness and was also on the commission of inquiry. everything proved that it was really he the very same soldier kolpakoff who had been given the usual military funeral to the sound of the drum. it is of course a most curious case nearly an impossible one. I recognize that... but father your dinner is ready said varvara at this point putting her head in at the door. very glad I m particularly hungry. yes yes a strange coincidence almost a psychological your soup ll be cold do come. coming coming said the general. son of my old friend he was heard muttering as he went down the passage. you will have to excuse very much in my husband if you stay with us said nina alexandrovna but he will not disturb you often. he dines alone. everyone has his little peculiarities you know and some people perhaps have more than those who are most pointed at and laughed at. one thing I must beg of you if my husband applies to you for payment for board and lodging tell him that you have already paid me. of course anything paid by you to the general would be as fully settled as if paid to me so far as you are concerned but I wish it to be so if you please for convenience sake. what is it varia varia had quietly entered the room and was holding out the portrait of nastasia philipovna to her mother. nina alexandrovna started and examined the photograph intently gazing at it long and sadly. at last she looked up inquiringly at varia. it s a present from herself to him said varia the question is to be finally decided this evening. this evening repeated her mother in a tone of despair but softly as though to herself. then it s all settled of course and there s no hope left to us. she has anticipated her answer by the present of her portrait. did he show it you himself she added in some surprise. you know we have hardly spoken to each other for a whole month. ptitsin told me all about it and the photo was lying under the table and I picked it up. prince asked nina alexandrovna I wanted to inquire whether you have known my son long I think he said that you had only arrived today from somewhere. the prince gave a short narrative of what we have heard before leaving out the greater part. the two ladies listened intently. I did not ask about gania out of curiosity said the elder at last. I wish to know how much you know about him because he said just now that we need not stand on ceremony with you. what exactly does that mean at this moment gania and ptitsin entered the room together and nina alexandrovna immediately became silent again. the prince remained seated next to her but varia moved to the other end of the room the portrait of nastasia philipovna remained lying as before on the work table. gania observed it there and with a frown of annoyance snatched it up and threw it across to his writing table which stood at the other end of the room. is it today gania asked nina alexandrovna at last. is what today cried the former. then suddenly recollecting himself he turned sharply on the prince. oh he growled I see you are here that explains it is it a disease or what that you can t hold your tongue look here understand once for all prince I am to blame in this gania no one else said ptitsin. gania glanced inquiringly at the speaker. it s better so you know gania especially as from one point of view the matter may be considered as settled said ptitsin and sitting down a little way from the table he began to study a paper covered with pencil writing. gania stood and frowned he expected a family scene. he never thought of apologizing to the prince however. if it s all settled gania then of course mr. ptitsin is right said nina alexandrovna. don t frown. you need not worry yourself gania I shall ask you no questions. you need not tell me anything you don t like. I assure you I have quite submitted to your will. she said all this knitting away the while as though perfectly calm and composed. gania was surprised but cautiously kept silence and looked at his mother hoping that she would express herself more clearly. nina alexandrovna observed his cautiousness and added with a bitter smile you are still suspicious I see and do not believe me but you may be quite at your ease. there shall be no more tears nor questions not from my side at all events. all I wish is that you may be happy you know that. I have submitted to my fate but my heart will always be with you whether we remain united or whether we part. of course I only answer for myself you can hardly expect your sister my sister again cried gania looking at her with contempt and almost hate. look here mother I have already given you my word that I shall always respect you fully and absolutely and so shall everyone else in this house be it who it may who shall cross this threshold. gania was so much relieved that he gazed at his mother almost affectionately. I was not at all afraid for myself gania as you know well. it was not for my own sake that I have been so anxious and worried all this time they say it is all to be settled to day. what is to be settled she has promised to tell me tonight at her own house whether she consents or not replied gania. we have been silent on this subject for three weeks said his mother and it was better so and now I will only ask you one question. how can she give her consent and make you a present of her portrait when you do not love her how can such a such a practised hand eh I was not going to express myself so. but how could you so blind her nina alexandrovna s question betrayed intense annoyance. gania waited a moment and then said without taking the trouble to conceal the irony of his tone there you are mother you are always like that. you begin by promising that there are to be no reproaches or insinuations or questions and here you are beginning them at once. we had better drop the subject we had really. I shall never leave you mother any other man would cut and run from such a sister as this. see how she is looking at me at this moment besides how do you know that I am blinding nastasia philipovna as for varia I don t care she can do just as she pleases. there that s quite enough gania s irritation increased with every word he uttered as he walked up and down the room. these conversations always touched the family sores before long. I have said already that the moment she comes in I go out and I shall keep my word remarked varia. out of obstinacy shouted gania. you haven t married either thanks to your obstinacy. oh you needn t frown at me varvara you can go at once for all I care I am sick enough of your company. what you are going to leave us are you too he cried turning to the prince who was rising from his chair. gania s voice was full of the most uncontrolled and uncontrollable irritation. the prince turned at the door to say something but perceiving in gania s expression that there was but that one drop wanting to make the cup overflow he changed his mind and left the room without a word. a few minutes later he was aware from the noisy voices in the drawing room that the conversation had become more quarrelsome than ever after his departure. he crossed the salon and the entrance hall so as to pass down the corridor into his own room. as he came near the front door he heard someone outside vainly endeavouring to ring the bell which was evidently broken and only shook a little without emitting any sound. the prince took down the chain and opened the door. he started back in amazement for there stood nastasia philipovna. he knew her at once from her photograph. her eyes blazed with anger as she looked at him. she quickly pushed by him into the hall shouldering him out of her way and said furiously as she threw off her fur cloak if you are too lazy to mend your bell you should at least wait in the hall to let people in when they rattle the bell handle. there now you ve dropped my fur cloak dummy sure enough the cloak was lying on the ground. nastasia had thrown it off her towards the prince expecting him to catch it but the prince had missed it. now then announce me quick the prince wanted to say something but was so confused and astonished that he could not. however he moved off towards the drawing room with the cloak over his arm. now then where are you taking my cloak to ha ha ha are you mad the prince turned and came back more confused than ever. when she burst out laughing he smiled but his tongue could not form a word as yet. at first when he had opened the door and saw her standing before him he had become as pale as death but now the red blood had rushed back to his cheeks in a torrent. why what an idiot it is cried nastasia stamping her foot with irritation. go on do whom are you going to announce nastasia philipovna murmured the prince. and how do you know that she asked him sharply. I have never seen you before go on announce me what s that noise they are quarrelling said the prince and entered the drawing room just as matters in there had almost reached a crisis. nina alexandrovna had forgotten that she had submitted to everything she was defending varia. ptitsin was taking her part too. not that varia was afraid of standing up for herself. she was by no means that sort of a girl but her brother was becoming ruder and more intolerable every moment. her usual practice in such cases as the present was to say nothing but stare at him without taking her eyes off his face for an instant. this manoeuvre as she well knew could drive gania distracted. just at this moment the door opened and the prince entered announcing nastasia philipovna ix.\n"

    "### Problema\n",
    "Você deseja explorar a manipulação de strings.\n",
    "### Solução\n",
    "A maneira mais simples é usar a seguinte funcionalidade de string.\n",
    "* s.find(t) é um índice da primeira instância da string t dentro de s (–1 se não for encontrado)\n",
    "* s.rfind(t) é um índice da última instância da string t dentro de s (–1 se não for encontrado) encontrado)\n",
    "* s.index(t) é como s.find(t) exceto que gera ValueError se não for encontrado\n",
    "* s.rindex(t) é como s.rfind(t) exceto que gera ValueError se não for encontrado\n",
    "* s.join (texto) combina as palavras do texto em uma string usando s como cola\n",
    "* s.split(t) divide s em uma lista onde quer que um t seja encontrado (espaço em branco por padrão)\n",
    "* s.splitlines() divide s em uma lista de strings, uma por linha\n",
    "* s.lower() é uma versão em minúscula da string s\n",
    "* s.upper() é uma versão em maiúsculas da string s\n",
